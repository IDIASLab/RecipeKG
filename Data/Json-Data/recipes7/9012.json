TIPS: Dont use reduced fat or fat free cream cheese. After you have made the swirls, and before you put in oven, VERY gently tap the pan on the counter to remove some bubbles that may have formed when swirling. ** Remember, oven baking times will vary! The batch I just did today took close to 40 minutes at 345 degrees.",

The 1/4 cup of batter was what I had to drop by dollops onto the cream cheese mixture and not drizzle because it was too thick. I baked for it 45 minutes and not 30 - 35 minutes as the recipe states. The edges were getting very brown but the inside was not quite cooked. It tastes okay but not something I would make again. Very disappointing.",
