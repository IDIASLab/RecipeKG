I chopped it into fairly small pieces. I had to microwave frozen rhubarb for about 6 minutes in my microwave to get it juicy. I also recommend you let it cool completely to thicken up like the first reviewer said. It is a bit too liquidy if you don't let it cool. With these changes this pie is is fantastic!",

I am however always open to trying new things and am I ever glad about that because rhubarb took saskatoon pie to another level. The submitter's claims are all spot on. Saskatoons aren't known for their incredible juiciness (although they have an unbeatable flavor) therefore the rhubarb adds the much needed juices while still allowing the berries to be the star of the show. It also added a very pleasant 'just right' tartness that was a perfect complement. The filling was a perfect consistency holding the fruit in nicely. Only wanting one pie this time and using from scratch pie crust I cut the recipe in half and filled my 9 inch not 8 inch pie plate. When I make this again I'll make the entire recipe and fill my 9\" deep dish pie pan for a mile high pie especially in light of the fact that the filling holds itself so well. The rhubarb I used had been frozen so it only needed a minute in the microwave to yield it's juices. Thanks for a wonderful recipe Stacy!",

It is better to make your own crusts if you can - enough for two double crust pies; but the frozen pie crusts work fine as well. Just make sure you have enough for two or else freeze the remaining filling for later. This is our favorite pie hands down.

Don't worry too much about temp or time just make sure that the mix clarifies to a deep reddish purple before you take them out and it will be fine.
