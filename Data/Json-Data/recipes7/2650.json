Very easy to prepare and it was a big hit for even the ones that didn't usually enjoy squash. Depending on the size of the butter nut squash as compared to the normal size of acorn squash I ended up adjusting the amount of ingredients. For example the butternut squash I obtained at Thanksgiving was much larger than normal so for 2 squash I tripled the amount of ingredients. However the butternut squashed I obtained at Christmas was comparatively smaller so I doubled the ingredients.",

The squash seemed a little soupy when I put it in the oven but it firmed up nicely and became very light and creamy. We loved the crunchy topping and it was a wonderful side dish with ham this past Easter Sunday. The next time I make it I might add some pumpkin pie-type spices (cinnamon clove ginger) and see how we like it that way. Other than that I might get some half & half so I can try sticking closer to the original recipe! Overall a great recipe that seems very flexible and easy to make.",
