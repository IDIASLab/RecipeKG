I used \"soured\" lactose-free milk and I added two teaspoons of dried lemon zest--I made no other changes. I got exactly 16 medium sized muffins out of this recipe. Baked at 350 degrees, they were done at exactly 20 minutes. This quick bread recipe is absolutely wonderful. The muffins looked like something you'd see on the front of a cooking magazine! The muffins turned out moist, perfectly sweetened with the perfect amount of blueberries. My whole family loved these!",

I used 1-1/4 cup blueberrys which were starting to look a little shriveled.  Turned out great!  Took them out of the oven (350) at 22 minutes as the blueberries were popping!  Yum!  As the other review mentions, they do not look done - I was waiting for them to brown, but finally decided to get them out before they dried out too much.  Will make again.  Hubby thought they were \"not bad\" which is a fair compliment coming from him :)  They aren't the worlds best, but definitely worth keeping as I haven't found the \"worlds best\" yet.",

The interior was soft and the outside was more muffin like. I liked the sugar and butter coating. The cake was sweet without being overly sweet tasting. I halved the recipe to try it and baked it in a 8x8 pan. I didn't think it looked blended enough by hand so I ended up using a mixer and beating it about 2 minutes. Make sure to watch it carefully. The outside and bottom was finished baking well before the top appeared to be so. I thought it tasted better the next day after it all softened also.",
