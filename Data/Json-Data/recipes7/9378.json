I was a little generous with the chocolate ingredients (slightly heaping cocoa and Ghirardelli chocolate chips) because I wanted a very chocolate flavor and one review said it did not have a double chocolate flavor. I loved it my daughter thought it was to strong chocolate flavor for her. Added it to my favorites and will make again for sure. Thanks for the recipe!",
