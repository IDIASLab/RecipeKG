I didn't have parchment so I used waxed paper instead which made them very moist on the bottom. I would like to have instructions on how to know when they are done. The one other time I made biscotti I noticed it seemed rather heavy so I added a pinch more baking powder to this recipe and liked the results. I noticed when they were baking there wasn't much aroma and found they didn't have much pumpkin flavor but were good anyway. I might try cutting back to one egg and adding another 1/4 cup pumpkin next time. Not sure how that would work.",
