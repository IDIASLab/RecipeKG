It isn't!!  I will definitely measure next time also will reduce baking time to 30 minutes as I misread baking suggestions!  Over baked at 35 minutes tops are very brown, yet rolls are soft and perfect!!!\n\nThanks for posting!!!",

Both rise times were longer for me but that may be because I am not at a high altitude.  My rolls baked to an internal temperature of 205 degrees in 30 minutes.  I had to cover them with foil in the last 10 minutes since they were doughy in the middle.  I might adjust the baking temp to 350 next time.  The filling was very sweet for me but I don't have a big sweet tooth.  I will cut the brown sugar by half and I prefer to work with softened butter rather than melted but these are personal preferences.  I don't usually frost my cinnamon buns but this frosting was very good, not overly sweet.  All in all a very nice recipe that I will definitely make again.",
