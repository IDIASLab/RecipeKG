I always bake mine at 350\u00b0 and I put them back into their cardboard/cardstock container before baking.  Then I place the container directly on a baking sheet or foil lined baking sheet to reduce clean up time. They have never burned. I just bake until the cheese is melted. I do not like Swiss cheese so we always make 1 ham and provolone, 1 turkey and provolone, and 1 roast beef and muenster. I try and make enough sauce to spoon a tablespoon of sauce on each mini sandwich. I make sure and slice before saucing...so that all the goodness runs down between each roll. Everyone always asks for the recipe...and I always say...I'm sworn to secrecy.  For enough sauce for 3 packages of 12 rolls I use\n2 sticks of butter\n1/2 cup sugar\n3 Tbs mustard\n3 Tbs poppy seeds\n3 Tbs minced onions\n\nYou can put the sandwiches back in their packaging and freeze if you wish to make some ahead of time. Just thaw them out in the fridge the day before. \nMake it! It's awesome!",
