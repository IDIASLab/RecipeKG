I don't think I'd qualify this as a \"sweet Italian\" vinaigrette, but more of a \"sweet mustard\" vinaigrette with a bit of a kick from the red pepper flakes. I cut the recipe in half and knew right away that 1/2 cup of sugar was going to be waaaay to sweet so I used 1/4 cup (2 Tbsp. of Splenda). I upped the red pepper flakes a bit and used white wine vinegar. I didn't have corn oil so I used olive oil and half that amount - 1/2 cup. I put everything into my   mini-food processor and gave let it go. Since it was a bit on the thin side I added 1 & 1/2 tsp. of dijon mustard. Next time I will most likely cut back even more on the sugar....but overall the sweet and spicy can be adjusted to one's personal taste. Very good over mixed greens.",

Since it makes a lot, I went ahead and tossed the salad with it and everyone liked it, a lot.  It has just the right heat to go with the sweet and it works.  Different from the usual, but good.  I know I will try this again, but recommend the recipe be cut in half for first time users as it makes a lot and the sweet/hot combination might not be to your liking.  The only substitution I made was red wine vinegar for white vinegar.",

At the suggestion of others I cut back slightly on the sugar but since I'm a fan of poppy seed dressings and other sweet concoctions. I didn't think this was too sweet unless you drown your salad. Use it sparingly and you'll be fine. I really liked the garlic flavor and the tang that the red pepper gave this recipe - I'll be making it regularly. Thanks!",
