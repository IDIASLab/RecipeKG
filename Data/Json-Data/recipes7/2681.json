Dry mix can be purchased.\n\nThe mixture stays easily on a pizza stone for baking.\nThis ensures the bread 'free-forms' as it should without using a spray buttered pan.\n\nI have uploaded two photos.\nPhoto #7 shows the consistency of the pre-baked bread and #8 shows the finished product.\nServe with Irish smoked salmon.\n\nUPDATE: 17th Mar 2011\nI deleted some info to include this...\nReviewers  have mentioned the bread as being \"too crumbly\".\nToday I added 1 egg to the mixture and found it to be \"tighter\". See Photo #10 for the texture after egg addition.",

I had never heard of wheaten and was a bit concerned by the lack of yeast or rising time in the recipe. I did an internet search and found out that in wheaten (aka brown Irish soda bread) the buttermilk and baking soda cause the bread to rise during baking. The bread doubled in size during baking and had the consistency of cornbread; in fact we had it with chili and it was excellent. It would be great with any meal that you'd typically have bread as an accompaniment. The dough was sticky and did not lend itself well to being free formed on a flat pan. I used the bottom of a ceramic tortilla warmer as a pan. A round cake pan would probably work well too. I used 2 TB butter instead of 1/4 cup margarine reduced the oil to 1/8th of a cup and used low fat buttermilk. The bread was still very moist and did not feel or taste \"low-fat\". I also did not sprinkle sugar on top before baking as I wanted a more savory bread.",

The bread looked so gorgeous when it came out of the oven it was a shame to cut into it! And to all who have never tried wheaten bread this recipe gives the authentic taste and texture! Please try it toasted as well to bring out the nutty flavor of the wheat! On my first trip to Belfast to meet the in-laws I was given the family's recipe for wheaten bread and the bowl that the flour was measured in. I haven't made wheaten bread in some time and thought I'd give your recipe (which is different from mine) a try. It is Wonderful! One tip: whenever I have to cut in butter or margarine into flour I grate the margarine/butter over the flour. The smaller pieces are easier to cut in and it takes less time.",

This bread has a wonderful hearty texture and natural nuttyness from the whole wheat. As suggested by another reviewer I used only 2 T. butter and 1/8 c. oil also only 1 tsp. salt and no sugar with outstanding results. It smelled amazing while it baked and tasted delicious after it cooled a bit and the next day toasted. This recipe is a winner! Update I have made this bread more times than any other recipe on this site. I have added varying combinations of seeds nuts and dried fruits (be creative) mix seeds nuts and/or dried fruits into the dry ingredients. This recipe is adaptable as long as you stay with the original amounts of flours b. soda and buttermilk. This recipe deserves more than 5 stars!!",
