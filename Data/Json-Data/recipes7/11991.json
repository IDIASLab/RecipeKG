I highly recommend that you Rinse and really clean your Fresh Pumpkin Seeds.  Then place them on clean paper towels, on a Baking Sheet, and air them out for at least 24-hours to remove the moisture.  Then follow this Recipe exactly, but turn them every 15 minutes and don't be surprised if they only take 30 minutes to cook (and not 40 minutes).",

The second time I forgot this but after the recommended 40 min. of baking I noticed they were just simmering in there so I removed the seeds from the oven and drained the excess butter. Then baked for another 20min. They have good flavor and without the butter they toast up nicely. I have also tried a savoring/spicy recipe which toasted nicely but we prefer the sweetness of these flavors. Next time I am going to try a different sweet recipe.",
