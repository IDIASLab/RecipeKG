I melted 3/4 of a cup of milk chocolate morsels and 1.5 Tbs of peanut butter in the microwave for 45 seconds and spread that over the top of the mixture.

I tried to press it into a pan but it didn't work. We ended up eating it like granola by the handfuls. It was delicious!! I'm going to try again today. Maybe I'll boil it on a lower setting or add more liquid. I'm giving four stars because it did taste incredibly good and none of the other reviewers had the same problem as I did.",
