As with most cheesecakes, there is a crust and a filling to be baked; a topping, to be spread over the baked and cooled cheesecake, prior to refrigeration;  and the 6 reserved cookies are to be crumbled and sprinkled over the topping of the cheesecake for a garnish, which I did, before I put the cheesecake in the fridge.
