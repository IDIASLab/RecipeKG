I used a Bulgarian feta which wasn't as salty as the Greek variety can be so the salt factor was lacking in the final product. I still prefer traditional spanakopita though.",

Also tried to cut back on the amount of feta (2 1/3 cups seemed like an awful lot) which I'm guessing would have made a huge difference.
