This delicacy is traditionally made with a dough filled with either bele hoorna (dal stuffing) or kobbari hoorna (coconut stuffing). I tried and tested this raisin (drakshi hoorna) holige recipe and it was a big hit during a recent festival celebration at home. It tastes heavenly with a side of almond-flavored milk (badam milk).",
