I have done so many different flavor combinations w/ this recipe, and it always turns out fantastic~YUM! :) NOTE: If you happen to have a candy thermometer handy, you will want to bring the mixture to 234 degrees, then continue w/ the recipe.

Use butter for sure, it lends so much better flavor than margarine. I have never used marshmallow creme though, just a bag of good old miniature marshmallows, 10 ounces is fine or the bigger bag of 16 ounces is okay too. They melt in just fine along with the chocolate chips. That way, you can just keep marshmallows and chocolate chips on hand, they're good for many other things, and then you're ready to make this on the spur of the moment. If you want, you can stir the miniature marshmallows in not quite completely in, and you have a rocky-road fudge. Also, I toast 2 cups or more of walnut or pecan halves in the oven (about 350 degrees, maybe 10 minutes?) till they are fragrant and slightly colored. The toasted nuts taste fantastic in this fudge, and there's no need to chop them at all!",

If you want to try this again, buy a candy thermometer and cook until it's 234 degrees, then remove from the stove and add, marshmallow, choc. chips, and vanilla.  If it gets not hot enough it will be mushy.  TOO hot and it will crystalize.  To have directions that read EX number of minutes on the stove just doesn't quite do it. Some people have electric stoves, others gas burners.  Best to use a thermometer and not run the risk of wasting all your ingredients.  I, myself, learned this the hard way.",
