        "description": "Though it translates to 'unemployed man's pudding,' pouding chomeur isn't cheap to make. The good news is you don't really need to eat this more than a few times a year anyway. It's the perfect dessert to pair with summer fruit or vanilla ice cream. If you use a bigger baking dish than I did, and pour over all the maple cream syrup, your cake should float over a pool of what will eventually be your sauce. If you just use a deep pie dish like I did, then just serve the extra sauce on the side.",

Truth be told, the cake part was about the same, but she would bake it in a square glass dish (8in x 8in), which allowed all the liquid to be poured onto, which turned this moistened cake into a pudding. \n\nI highly recommend the use of a dish allowing all the cream/sirup to be poured and baked with the cake.",

Now that I am in California, did a \"Canadian Themed\" dinner and this was a perfect dessert. It was creamy, not overly sweet because I didn't add all the sugar to the cake part. Served it with vanilla bean ice cream and berries. Everyone loved the dessert and wanted more. Give it a try as it will not disappoint and it is super easy to make!!",
