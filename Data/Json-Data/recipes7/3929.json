It gave them a nice subtle orange flavor and the house smells wonderful. I have no sense of depth so some of mine are rolled too thick and some too thin. The too thin are actually perfect. They're very crisp got nicely brown around the edges and held their shape very well. I was concerned with no chill time for this dough that they'd expand but most of mine were fine. The ones that were too thick did spread a bit but that was my fault. The dough was easy to work with too. I lightly floured my rolling surface and they were easy to peel off and bake. I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe since cutout cookies are usually a real pain to me. But I'll make these again for sure.",
