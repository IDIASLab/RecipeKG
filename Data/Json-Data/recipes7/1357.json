You can use beef if you like, but it often takes a little longer to cook, so just leave it simmering for another 20 minutes or until the meat melts in your mouth. I also suggest that you make this 2 days in advance as the flavors will develop and the curry will become even more delicious!",

I cut the recipe in half then used a teeny bit more than it called for and it was too strong at first. It's mellowed but just be careful 2) it took 2 1/2 hours for my leg of lamb meat (cut into pieces) to get tender not 1 1/2! 3) you will need to add salt at the end! It doesn't call for it but you do need it!I know that's probably common sense but just wanted to make a note. Enjoy!",

As per other reviews I went easy on gthe tamarind and since the instructions don't say when to add the curry leaves I added them with the cardamom and fennel. Funny thing about the curry leaves. HAving never made curry before I went to an Indian grocery store and asked if they had them. \"Yes.\" he said and went back to his bookkeeping. \"Um where are they?\" \"In my store.\" I tried not to laugh. I had no idea where to look. Smart aleck. Finally asking if he could be a bit more specific he sent someone to show us where they were. (In the refrigerated sectio for those of you that don't frequent Indian grocery stroes) Served this over basmati rice with premade naan mint chutney and plain yogurt. I would have made mango salad if they were in season but cucumber salad would have been good too. YUM!",
