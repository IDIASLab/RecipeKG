I like this dressing over a mixed green salad, potato salad (yes, it actually works) and even grilled salmon or warm roast turkey breast and glazed ham steaks at Christmas. I really love the color of this dressing - whatever it touches looks so pretty.",

I eliminated the salt used green onions from the garden instead of shallots. I also cut the sugar down to 2 tsps. I used slivered almonds which I ground just by chopping it up with a knife. I had no parsley pepper flakes so I didn't add those. Also I thought adding garlic might be odd- so I didn't add that either. I used this on a very colorful salad: fresh spring greens blueberries strawberries orange tomato fresh broccoli crowns sprinkled with sunflower seeds. I didn't use the garlic because the intended salad was fruit-heavy. Overall it was great!",
