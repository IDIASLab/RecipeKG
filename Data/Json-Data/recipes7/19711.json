                "reviewBody": "Fantastic cookies! The whole wheat flour adds another dimension of flavor to these chocolate chip cookies--almost a nuttiness--that's delicious! These are simple to make, too. The dough gets a bit thick though, so I had to kind of knead in the chocolate chips and walnuts, no big deal, but it does require a bit of oomph to get everything incorporated. And make sure to flatten the tops of cookies before you bake them--I forgot to for the first batch and they puffed up a bit more than what I like. Still tasted great, but flattening them out a bit makes for a more \"typical\" chocolate chip cookie shape. I got 42 cookies out of this (using  a medium cookie scoop), and they took 10 minutes to bake. Thank you for the recipe--I will most definitely be making these again!",
