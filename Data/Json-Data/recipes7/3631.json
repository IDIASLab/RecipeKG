I used my bread machine to make the dough and placed the ingredients into the bread machine in the exact order listed in this recipe and it works great! I wanted some smaller rolls to take to work to share so today I followed the recipe to a tee but after I rolled the dough out and put the butter and cinnamon suger on I used a pizza cutter to cut the whole thing in half lenghthwise. Then I rolled the two halves up separately and cut each one into twelve pieces giving me 24 \"mini-rolls\". I have them in the oven now but am watching them to see if I need to reduce the cooking time by a couple of minutes for the smaller rolls. Worked beautifully!",

I proofed the yeast with the warm water and the sugar for ten minutes in the mixer bowl then added the vegetable oil flour dry milk powder (I used dry BUTTERMILK powder) and salt. We did need a little more flour than what was called for. We kneaded the dough with the bread hook for about five minutes then set the dough to rise for an hour or so on a warm heating pad. I rolled out the dough and my son mixed the softened butter together with the sugar and cinnamon and spread it on the rolled out dough (it was just easier for him to do it that way). We sliced them up and set them in a baking pan covered them with foil and set them in the fridge to set overnight. We'll update our review once we bake them in the morning. EDITED: I took them out of the fridge this morning and set them on a warm baking sheet to finish out the second rise. 400 for about 15 minutes and we were in business. I used Cinnamon Roll Icing to drizzle over the top which is also on this site. These were okay but not our favorite. It didn't seem to have enough of the cinnamon sugar filling and these seemed a little on the dry side even with icing.",

They aren't the huge gross overly-sweet and overly-sticky cinnamon buns available at the store or a certain cinnamon roll shop found in malls and air ports. These cinnamon rolls are just sweet enough small enough that one roll is a reasonable portion for one person and the rolls are delicious iced lightly with a cream cheese frosting. These cinnamon rolls didn't last a day when I made them for my friends and family and I'll definitely make them again. The only change I made was to add extra cinnamon to the cinnamon-sugar mixture and I iced them with a vanilla cream cheese frosting.",

After I rolled out the dough I brushed it with a little butter and then used about 4 and a half processed light cheese slices as the filling. (Only because my toddler loves them but they would be awesome with shredded cheddar!) Rolled it all up and sliced then baked as directed. The buns were soft and fluffy not too dense or too sweet.
