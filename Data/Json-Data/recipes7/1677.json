There were some awkwardly large chunks I wanted to squish in there. I would go as far as 4c. rhubarb - 2c. apples or even 5 to 1 for a stronger rhubarb flavor! Rather sweet; even with granny smith apples to go with the rhubarb. Tastes like an apple pie jam really. Will take it into account for next time! (Also: after waiting the full 20 minutes hoping the apples would finish cooking down it had cooked to about half the expected amount! I have three sadly empty half-pint jars left lonely on the counter. Will need to find something else to fill them with.:D )",
