I used parchment on my favorite cookie sheets with a 1 T cookie scoop. I was so sad to check on them after just 8 min to see that I no longer had 20 cookies. The next sheet I put them farther apart and the same thing happened. On the last sheet I had dough for 7 cookies and the same thing happened. IF I try these again I might just a few in the oven and if they spread like they did today I'll put the rest in a 9X13\" pan to make a bar cookie then I'll throw away the recipe.",

To prevent the cookies from spreading I did the following. After mixing, ROLL cookie dough into 1 & 1/2 inch balls, instead of dropping by spoonful\u2019s. Place in shallow pan so they are not touching. Chill in refrigerator for at least 2 hours. After 2 hours, preheat oven to 350 degrees. While oven is preheating place 12 cookie dough balls in the freezer (15 minutes). Remove cookie dough balls from freezer and place them on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Bake 13-15 minutes until golden. While baking place next batch of cookie dough balls in freezer. Rest 3-4 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Bake remaining cookie dough balls or freeze up to three months.These cookies are delicious!",
