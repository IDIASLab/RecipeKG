It was wonderful!  The second time I used fresh peaches and it needed the sugar.  I keep the little 9 ounce cake mixes in the pantry just for this recipe but I have doubled it and used a whole cake mix (in a much larger pot) and it turned out great!  I have used several different fruits, altering the spices to match the fruit (apple pie spice with apples, etc.) and they have all turned out very well.  I made it once with chocolate cake and strawberries and served it with whipped cream on top - YUMMY!  This is an awesome and very versatile recipe!  I made it today for some unexpected guests, a single mother with three kids, and she was impressed with how fast and easy it was.  When she tasted it she made me give her the copy of the recipe I had printed out on the spot and took it with her!\n\n",

I agree with another member if using canned peaches in heavy syrup omit the sugar as there is plenty in the cake mix to go around and balance the flavor. Also I halved the amount of cinnamon called for and added about a 1/4 Tsp. of nutmeg and found that to be enough flavoring without overpowering the taste of the peaches. One more note the famous cornbread people (you know the one in the small blue box) makes a cake mix also that comes in the right size so that you don't have to worry about halving a standard-sized box of cake mix. Overall the family loved this recipe! It is definitely going into our permanent cooking file. Thank you for sharing this easy recipe with us.",

I've made if w/3 different fruits--peaches cherries & apples--& all were hits w/my family. I made it exactly like the recipe calls for the first time & it was a little too sweet for us. The next time I left out the sugar & cut WAY back on the cake mix that I put on top. Used about 1/8 of the box instead of 1/2. Also I melted the butter before drizzling over the cake mix & it seemed to work out better. When I made it the next 2 times I used canned cherry & apple pie fillings & again omitted the extra sugar. I time it so that the dessert is cooking on the stovetop while we're eating supper & when we're done we have a freshly made deliciously warm dessert ready for us. Great recipe!",

I also used vanilla cake mix over yellow because something about vanilla ice cream with cobbler that I love. Peach cinnamon and vanilla. Since we won't be able have ice cream I thought this was the way to do it. I wasn't disappointed. I also used butter over margarine because I don't like the flavor of margarine. I used 1.5 times the recipe for my large cast iron skillet (buttered well to prevent sticking) and made this recipe on my coleman stove. My universal lid didn't fit very tightly but this still came out well. I kept it on a med-high flame (my stove is old and finicky) for about 20 minutes peeking after the first 10. The consistency of the peaches was nice some were even slightly caramelized toward the center of the skillet. The topping was moist but did have some characteristing \"crumbs\" that made the dish look rather attractive for its simplicity. Very very sweet but when you're camping you can afford the rich recipe. Only 4 stars because frankly if I was spending a summer night at home I'd make fresh peach cobbler the old fashioned way. That said I've done a lot of camp cooking and this is the best dessert I've had to date. I can't wait to serve this to our group!",
