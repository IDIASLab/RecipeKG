So I would hesitate to use canned peaches in heavy sugar syrup with the same amount of sugar in this recipe but of course its a matter of taste.\n\nI do not have a large oval crockpot.  I have a round full size crockpot as well as one with about half the capacity. So I put 2/3 of the recipe in the larger and the remaining 1/3 in the smaller.  Cooked on high for the time indicated and it was perfect.\n\nI took the larger cake to our block party where it was well received and froze the smaller cake for a week to serve at a meeting.  So I can attest that it freezes well at least short-term.\n\nPlan to keep this as a basic recipe to use with any fruit.  Apples will be wonderful.",

Everyone enjoyed it and since it wasn't the prettiest (I have added a pic) we could joke about how my dad would always say \"should I eat it or did I eat it\" when my mom made a dessert!
