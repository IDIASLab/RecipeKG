Also since I didn't have any espresso at hand I substituted it with 1/4 cup boiling water added to 3/4 tsp of instant coffee (I halved the recipe). This latte was absolutely heavenly plus it's so quick and easy to prepare! And you can make lots of variants to boot by replacing the white chocolate with milk or dark chocolate or something else you'd like try. Make sure you chop up the chocolate well or it'll end up as melty lumps at the bottom of your mug. This is definitely the perfect latte recipe:)!",
