I decided to add both cocoa powder and chocolate chips to address that issue. I subbed cocoa powder for a 1/2 cup of the flour and added 1 cup of chocolate chips. The dough was dry probably bc I subbed the cocoa powder so I used 2 eggs total to address that. I'd probably only use 3/4 c of chocolate chips next time if I use them; a little too many chocolate chips for this dough. The dough does not spread even though I didn't refrigerate it. I must say I'm surprised by that bc of the oils in the Nutella. Regardless I just dealt with that by squishing the cookies flat on the baking sheet prior to baking with a spatula. I baked mine for about 10 min. Thanks for the recipe! I'm excited I've found something to use our Nutella in. We love it but often forget about it!",

I'll need to play with this recipe because I think the ideal product will be like a brownie. I just haven't gotten there yet.

I followed the recipe exactly as it said give or take a few cooking minutes. But I am really disappointed with the cookies. I guess I was expecting something with a strong Nutella flavor so the weak chocolately flavor really burst my bubble. The cookie also came out really flat. And while I am at it I may as well add that this serves WAY more than just twelve. This could be a great recipe if someone did some major revision.",
