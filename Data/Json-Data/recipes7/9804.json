I started to make it from beginning to end and had mixed the lemon juice with cornstarch already when I realized that part of the recipe was for the syrup. I wasn't intending to make the syrup, as I already have blueberry syrup in my cupboard, so it was a waste of a couple of ingredients.  Perhaps whomever posted this recipe could separate the pancake recipe from the syrup recipe just to make it clear.  Thanks.",
