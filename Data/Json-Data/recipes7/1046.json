So I used 1 large zucchini and cut into 1\" slices then cut the slices into 4 pieces. 1 TBSP of salt is too much so I salt and peppered the pieces. I sauteed 1 sliced vidalia onion in olive oil. I mixed 1 TBSP of basil and 2 minced garlic cloves in a can of diced tomatoes. When the onion was soft I added the zucchini and tomatoes. Cooked over low-medium heat for 20-25 minutes. Stirring occasionally. Then sprinkled with generous amount of parmesan. (probably 1/4 - 1/2 cup) Mixed all together and cooked another 5 min. Not only is it good that night but left overs are just as tasty.",
