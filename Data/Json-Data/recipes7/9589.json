I am a brownie edge person and this dessert didn't disappoint.  It is chewy on the edges and soft in the middle.  The self-rising flour ( I used 'Self-Rising Flour' from AR) worked great and the batter rose beautifully and held it shape once the pan was removed from the oven.  I cut the pan with a plastic knife so that it would cut nice clean pieces.  Next time, I'm going to toast the pecans before adding them to the batter.  Patti'sPantry, thank you for sharing your recipe.  It is a winner in our house.",

You had to get there early otherwise she would be sold out. As I got older we saw her less and less... then not at all. She had passed away. It broke my heart. This is a little piece of my childhood. I'm hoping they will be as good as hers. But sometimes you cant recreate memories. Wish me luck!",
