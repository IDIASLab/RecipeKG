I love butternut squash and was quite happy with the filling - it was light and had a nice subtle flavor but I think the goat cheese should have been incorporated as part of the filling instead of the sauce. I wasn't too impressed with the sauce anyway although I didn't hate it. My biggest dislike about it was using red onions - even after caramelizing them they still had quite a strong bite to them and it just didn't fit. A sweeter onion would have worked nicely. I also loved the idea of cooking the shells on a bed of spinach but that kind of flopped for me - the spinach of course shrinks down so much after cooking that it was a little skimpy when served and part of it was a little dry. This dish was still pretty tasty - I think my issues probably have more to do with personal preference. Next time I'm adding the goat cheese to the filling baking the shells without the spinach and instead serving the shells on a nice plate of sauteed spinach using a somewhat lighter sauce - maybe something with a little parmesan added - and topping with a little more goat cheese. I think as is this was a 3 1/2-star recipe for me but could easily be a 5-star. This one is well worth trying but it just ended up being more of an inspiring meal for me as opposed to a satisfying one.",
