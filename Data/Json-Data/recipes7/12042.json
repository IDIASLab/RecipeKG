                "reviewBody": "The first thing I noticed when reading this recipe was the baking soda being dissolved in hot water.  Baking soda does not need this step but Baker's Ammonia (Ammonium Carbonate) does.  This lead me to believe this recipe was adapted to American ingredients.  I wanted to be true to the recipe so I made it twice...once with soda and once with ammonium.  Though I wanted to be true to the recipe I made a BIG mistake BOTH TIMES!  I omitted the white sugar but that turned out to be a good thing.  I creamed the Biscoff spread along with the butter and brown sugar.  For the soda version I added the water and cream to the wet ingredients and sifted the baking soda into the flour.  For the ammonium version I heated the water and cream.  I was careful to crush the crystals before adding to the hot liquid.  I bake on parchment so did not need the extra Tabelspoon of butter.  This was a nice cookie with just a hint of Biscoff flavor.  We did prefer the lighter airy Baker's Ammonia version.  Using a #60 scoop, which makes a 2 inch cookie, I got 88 cookies from one batch.  Bake time was reduced to 10 minutes for the smaller cookies. I am giving this four stars because had I added all the sugar they would have been too sweet.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, AC.",
