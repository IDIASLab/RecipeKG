The carrot cake batter was super thick and worried me a little but it came out moist; however it was kind of bland (and I even doubled cinnamon and added cloves allspice and ginger). I agree with other reviewer that cream cheese frosting seems redundant and I used sour cream as well plus cinnamon graham cracker crumbs and shredded carrot for garnish. This recipe could be improved with a graham cracker crust. I also added 1tbsp lemon juice 1 tsp lemon zest to the cheesecake batter.",
