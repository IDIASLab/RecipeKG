It's a recipe mostly passed on within families, and it is rare to find this dish in any Asian restaurant.  Trust me though, it is VERY good.  It's actually intentionally salty tasting, so it goes very well with white rice. Salty eggs are also called a Haam Daan- you can find them at all Asian supermarkets.",
