I had quite a bit left over. Second the cracker/butter mixture itself needed some sugar to sweetened it up a bit. The filling was not jiggly after baking for 40 minutes it was raw. A toothpick inserted at center kept coming out completely coated with the filling. I wound up baking it for 1 hr 45 minutes to finally achieve a jiggly center. And that was checking g it every 10-12 minutes. Then the issue with the apples. I used a mandolin to slice my apples very thinly and even with that lenghty bake time the apples were still on the crisp side. Because it was baked for so long the texture of the filling was very dense not creamy at all. Sorry but I do not recommend this cheesecake the way the recipe is written. I believe it has potential. But I won't be the one to experiment with it.",
