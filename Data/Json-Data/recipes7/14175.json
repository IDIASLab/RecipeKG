This calls for one less egg, a little more flour, half the sugar---but it's basically the same.  I tried to make it with just one tablespoon batter on my cast iron griddle, but I had better luck with two tablespoons.  I've never used butter on the griddle, so it took me a little getting used to (I usually give a very light brushover of Crisco).  My granddaughters thought these were a little more \"cushiony\" but still very good (they passed the big test!!)!  Powdered sugar, granulated sugar, or lingonberry jam are the traditional ways I know of how to serve Swedish pancakes, but we still prefer a little jam with sour cream in the middle with a smidgen of syrup on the rolled up top!  My four Swedish grandparents would be proud that their tradition has carried on!  Thanks for posting your recipe, Amber!",
