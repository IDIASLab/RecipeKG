Did not have orange zest, used orange peel.  These are all minor, though this last one is a biggie.  I did not have a can of cranberry sauce, could not tell you if I ever have or will.  So I used a half a cup or so of honey, added enough water to make it the consistency of what I think cranberry sauce would be and then added some  Craisin's.  The whole thing measured 1 cup.  I did add cinnamon and sugar to the first batch though forgot it on the second.  Loved it both ways!",

Right before baking, I sprinkled a little granulated sugar over each muffin mound. I did get 12 really big muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350*, they were done in just over 22 minutes. Though my husband did not care for these, the kids and I thought it was great. It had just enough sweetness from the cranberry sauce and the little bit of sugar that was added and these were VERY moist and flavorful. What a wonderful muffin recipe!",

These muffins are amazing, OMGoodness, I wanted to eat  them all at once.  It took will power, but I made them last...now...I can make more.  Next batch, I will try using a touch of orange juice; see if it makes a difference.  LOVE THIS RECIPE  I was trying different recipes to see what new recipe I might try for Thanksgiving, but I'm keeping this for myself!\nI have made these so many times, experimenting with what tastes best to me.  I found the coconut oil worked well when I ran out of applesauce.  I definitely love orange juice instead of water & by using only whole wheat flour creates a smoother batter and a very hearty (not too sweet) breakfast muffin.  I did dial back the oven temperature when I use the whole wheat flour only as it is less dense.\n\n\n**I made this recipe again, but realized I miss-read the cranberry sauce label.  After all the other ingredients were mixed and ready is when I realized it was cranberry concentrate.  So, I improvised Elderberry jelly.  I'm sure other jellies would work (depending on your flavor preference).   They turned out pretty good.  Very sweet (to me, because I don't eat sweet things)  But an overall success.",

I used a whole egg in place of the egg whites.  I used 1 c all-purpose flour and 1 c whole wheat flour instead of what was recommended.  And I also threw in some dried (sweetened) cranberries, chopped pecans, and shredded coconut.  \n\nI had to bake them a little more than 30 minutes, but I loved how they turned out!
