I used much less gravy than the original to make it look more like a fluffy frosting rather than a glaze. It was good. I gave one cupcake to my dog minus the frosting. She loved it. I will definitely make more of these for my granddogs and my pup. I am serving them to my hubby along with other snacks a veggie tray and dip while we watch the Browns/Steelers game today!",
