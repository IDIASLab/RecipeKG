My kiddos wouldn't even finish them. (and they are NOT the type to turn their nose up at Banana chocolate chip muffins).  Take two I tweaked.  Instant oats instead of rolled, a little vanilla and salt, and a good healthy glop of sour cream.  And a tiny bit (about half Tbs) of softened butter.  Now THAT was yummy. Yes, I know, I'm defeating the purpose of \"healthy\" - but one thing I have learned in my motherhood. It doesn't matter how healthy something is if none of your kids will eat it!",

I shied away from the full amount of whole wheat flour, subbing in a little white flour, but I love the whole wheat flavor so much (kind of nutty), that I wished I just followed the recipe on that point.  I think walnuts would be good.  Oh, one more thing\u2026 where is the salt in this recipe?  I added a 1/2 teaspoon which was good.  UPDATE: I made these again with coconut, walnuts and a sprinkle of flax seeds.  Delish!  Be sure to bake until they get a little browned on top for it makes them taste toasty.",
