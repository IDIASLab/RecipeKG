My girlfriend and I put this recipe together on a Sunday afternoon and it turned out better than expected. I can usually buy bulk beer brat sausage from a local grocery but they were out. So we got the links removed the casings and broke them up real fine while browning instead of cutting into pieces. Going to enter this recipe in a chili cookoff in a couple weeks. We hope everyone enjoys it as much as we did.",
