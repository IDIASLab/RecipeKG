It is similar to the skirt steak because it is full of flavor but can become tough if it is not prepared correctly. This can be a really nice cut of meat to serve your family without paying too much for it. I am going to give you detailed instructions on how to do just that. Enjoy!",

You can make your own if you can get veal bones and have the time. For those who are wondering Hanger Steak is pretty hard to find. On the SF Peninsula only Mollie Stone's carries this cut currently (I'm told by the owner that they're the only ones who still butcher from the whole animal which is why they have it.) It rocks! Well guarded secret of the butchers;-)",

Found a vegetable demi glace at the an upscale food market and went with that- it came in a 1.5 ounce cup and I needed to add hot water to make the demi glace. Also- had to use cooking sherry as we did not have Port but I must say this recipe is VERY forgiving! Used the whole shallots unchopped- cut the big ones in half. Served them with the steak and they were delicious. Worried a bit about the chewy comments- so I lightly tenderized the steaks after they had been sitting in the oil and salt and pepper a bit. This worked like a charm! Ample amount of sauce and we are sauce lovers. Will definitely make again and again!! TY!!",

The shallots on the steak tasted AMAZING. Oh and the green beans were so simple but some of the best I've ever had. Also did some grilled potatoes too.",
