Sauteed on low to medium heat a very rounded cup of vidalia diced onion in about a generous 1/4 cup of olive oil. S&P the onion while cooking. Cook until translucent about 6-8 minutes. Carefully added 2 healthy size diced cloves of garlic for only 30 - 45 seconds watch so it does not burn. Drained and added one 28 ounce can of diced organic tomatoes reserving the liquid. Added one small 8 ounce can of tomato sauce. To all of this added about 1.5 tablespoon of dried oregano (rub in your hands to release the oils) 1/8 cup of fresh parsley just had the fresh on hand. Little more S&P. Used 4 tablespoons of that reserved liquid here. Brought to a boil. Added 3 cans of organic drained green beans trial and error with this recipe has sold me on canned green beans for the texture and they marry well with the other ingredients. Add the lemon. AND 2 tablespoons of sugar (pinch just doesn't do it for us). Simmered for 25-30 minutes at the very end it was still a little too acidic -- a chef once told me to add butter to reduce the acidity from tomato based sauces. Added 1 tablespoon butter. Really really good.",
