They are the perfect sweetness. The combination of spices are perfect. I don't eat eggs, so I used my regular egg-substitute, which is one Tablespoon flax seed (ground) mixed with three Tablespoons of water for each egg.  I didn't have any buttermilk and didn't feel like running to the store at 7:00 a.m., so I used almond milk instead. I didn't have enough molasses to make 3/4 cup, so I used what I had, which was 1/2 cup. And the only other thing I changed was I used two pears instead of one because I had two left and wanted to use them both before they got too ripe and had to throw them away. (I hate to waste food.) I was a little nervous that maybe both pears would be too much, but it was just right. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I will be making these muffins often.",

I made  1 1/2 size batch, using 3 shredded pears, but I kept the spice ratio the same as written. I also did not have white sugar, so I used brown sugar. Maybe with the whole wheat flour it could need extra spices (as some other reviewers had suggested) , but we thought they had plenty of aroma and gingerbread flavor. I minced up some candied ginger and sprinkled it on top before baking. We made 2 dozen, and 8 were devoured while they were still warm. They are great next day, with some apricot jam, and they taste fresh from the oven after 15-30 seconds on low power in the microwave!!",
