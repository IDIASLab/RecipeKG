These turned out really good but I would leave out the nutmeg and allspice next time. I happened to have all of the spices on hand but if you didn't and had to go buy them all it would cost you a small fortune. I also found that these needed way more than 3 1/2 hours. Plan on at least 5. After I smoked for 2 hours in the vinegar I put the ribs back in the smoker uncovered for a couple more hours to get a nice bark on them and it was in those last 2 hours when they became fall off the bone tender.",
