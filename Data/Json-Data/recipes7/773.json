I also thickened it with a bit of corntstarch and cold water. Still it's nothing more than doctored up instant pudding. Actually the sauce is great on its own and would be wonderful over ice cream or pound cake or to top a basic cheesecake. These parfaits are great in a pinch for a quick emergency use of fresh strawberries which was exactly what I was looking for. Four stars for the sauce three for the dessert.",
