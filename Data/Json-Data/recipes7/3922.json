The taste/flavor was ok so I don't think omitting some of the Jello was an issue. For me it was more of a texture issue. I was expecting EITHER a cheesecake texture OR a much fluffier/lighter texture. And this one to me is a mix between the two and a little too 'cream-cheesey' (even though I like cream cheese). If I make it again I'll try to tweak it somehow......",
