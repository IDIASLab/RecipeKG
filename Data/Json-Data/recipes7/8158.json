        "description": "This is the best summer cocktail! Men love it. Women adore it. I got it from a friend, and she always used Jim Beam&reg;, but you can also use vodka or gin. Every time I serve these people beg me for the recipe and there isn't a drop left! If you like it less sweet, I suggest using ginger ale and scaling back on the sugar by 1/4 cup. I think this wouldn't affect the outcome too much. Seriously, you can use gin, bourbon, or vodka, but the bourbon is particularly refreshing in this! Ginger ale can be replaced with Sprite&reg; or 7-Up&reg;.",
