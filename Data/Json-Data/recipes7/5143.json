You need to flour it as well or you'll never get it out of your pan especially if you use a bundt pan like I did. I added chopped walnuts to mine. Flavor was very good and ready to eat as soon as it cooled. I find that with most quick breads they are better if you wait to eat them a few days after baking- no need to wait with this one. It even made a nice crunchy crust.",
