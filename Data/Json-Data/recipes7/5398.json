For the red part I used clear raspberry-flavored vodka and added some red food coloring. You have to work really quickly with this recipe as the ice melts the colors meld together. (I made a pretty big mess trying to get a good photo!) If it's a hot day like today you might want to use a lot more ice. I think this drink works best in a tall skinny glass.",

The only reason I m giving it 3 stars is because I see in the footnotes that it states to adjust the amount of alcohol to taste or substitute with other flavors in which case I would do all of the above. The trick to getting the beautiful rainbow of colors is to mix up the ices in advance and store in separate containers in the freezer until ready to use.",
