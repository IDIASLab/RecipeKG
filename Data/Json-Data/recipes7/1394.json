For those who prefer crispy to squishy tofu, I would recommend using much smaller cubes of tofu rather than larger ones so as to allow maximum surface area for frying and minimum squishy space inside the cubes. :) The only real downside to this recipe was that the warm tofu combined with the dressing caused the greens to become fairly wilted, decreasing the visual appeal and crispiness of the salad greens. However, I enjoyed the taste of the dish. Good recipe.",

I let that simmer and blend together for 5 min on med heat. Took it off to cool and then tossed that with the salad before adding the fried tofu. This technique will be my base for a lot more tofu salads to come.",
