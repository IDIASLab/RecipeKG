Perfect sweetness, perfect flavor. I did use half white sugar, and half brown sugar because I wanted a little molasses flavor, but that was all I changed. Without the icing it's a healther little snack cake, and I will make it again for sure! Thanks for the recipe!",

I added a little more cinnamon than called for and a dash of nutmeg.
