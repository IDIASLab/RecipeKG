The orange peel which we used gives a subtle burst of summery \"creamsicle\" alongside the berries but could be omitted. Also for the sake of simplicity we layered everything in a trifle bowl. Parfaits are nicer if you have them. This would be lovely garnished with a bit of reserved whipped cream and a mint sprig or sprinkle of orange zest!",
