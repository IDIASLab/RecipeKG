I have made them following the recipe exactly and made them with the change others recommended which is using half white sugar and half brown sugar. I think the pecans turn out better with the sugar mixture: half white half brown. I also use vanilla extract in place of the water. For easy clean up I place aluminum foil on the cookie sheet spray it with PAM and after baking throw it away. Easy and delicious.....my kind of recipe!",
