Also, the mortar and pestle is something you pick up at a garage sale as decoration and not something used in the kitchen. I followed the instructions and used a mini chopper instead of the mortar and pestle. I also doubled the marinade recipe and used have as a marinade and the other half for basting. I am not big on heating used marinade for basting (I guess it's a bug thing I have). The tenderness of the chops depends on your grilling ability. The chops went well with the spicy salsa. Served with steamed rice and was a big hit. Great recipe all around and will do again. Thanks!",

I also baked the pork at 350 for about 50 minutes instead of grilling. I put salsa with it in the pan and sealed it with aluminum foil.

The key to any pork chop is not to overcook it and to only turn it once on the grill (never close the lid while cooking meet and it's stays moist).  Will be adding this to my rotation of dinners.

When I read the recipe I wasn't sure how it would taste given the amalgamation of ingredients (e.g. white pepper has a very pungent flavor and so I always want to use it very sparingly) but when I cooked the chutney ingredients together as written I realized that the flavor combination is excellent. Instead of grilling I just covered the chops in the sauce and baked in the oven for an hour at 350 degrees. Served over rice. It tasted great. Thanks for the recipe - I will be making this again.",
