I don\u2019t have a bread machine, so I stirred the dough together and kneaded for a few minutes until smooth before setting it aside to rise. I omitted the raisins (personal preference), and only used 2 Tbsp sugar and 2 Tbsp butter in the dough. Do watch your baking time - I covered the loaf with foil after about 25 minutes to prevent excess browning, and it took only 38 minutes to be completely baked. I also rubbed the top crust with butter while it was still hot. This bread has much better flavor and texture than other cinnamon swirl bread recipes I\u2019ve tried using commercial yeast. Excellent, easy recipe!",

I read a previous review from Mrs. R who also does not  have a bread machine.  Thank you to her for sharing how to move forward without the machine.
