My Aunt Martha (who is the goddess of baking) even said it was absolutely delicious! Here's some tips though: Add a little more pumpkin spice. Not too much to overcome the cheesecake flavor, but to make it really burst in your mouth. Grease the pan (obviously). And cut it TWICE: once about twenty minutes after its baked and setting, and the other time about four hours after you put it in the fridge. It'll help getting it out. The cookie wont stick to the bottom if you let it cool before you pour the pumpkin in. And this tastes wonderful with whipped cream. :] I was going to put a picture up, but everyone snatched it before I could get a piece to myself!",

Cheesecake can be a little difficult in terms of knowing when it has been baked long enough, but this recipe turned out perfect after baking the filling for just 30 minutes.  I did use a 9.5\" X 13.5\" pan as opposed to 9 X 13, and used the entire container of sugar cookie dough (which turned out to be a hair less than the 16oz stated in this recipe).  As the previous review stated, make sure to spray the pan before you press in the cookie dough, or you will have a difficult time getting them out.  These were definitely a hit with everyone I work with! ",

I used one of those mixes of cookie dough that you just throw in the extra ingredients and wa-la you have cookie dough. I did use reduced fat cream cheese (for all the good that did really) and I used homemade pumpkin pie spice which I increased to two teaspoons and organic pumpkin mash I made myself. This is pretty darn good though I think I might use a different sugar cookie base next time. I don't know if I'll make it and keep it at home next time. It's really freaking good and really not diet friendly. The only reason I didn't five star it is because I think it needs the extra spice. I wish there was an option for four and a half.",

Like other reviewers I could not find cinnamon chips so I used approximately 8 oz. of butterscotch chips for a touch of flavor then sprinkled cinnamon on top of the pumpkin mixture. The chips melted through the cookie dough and stuck to the bottom of the pan (which I did spray before spreading in the cookie dough). I lost most of the cookie layer due to the melted chips and had more of a cream cheese bar instead. What a mess in the pan though! Next time I would either use more cookie dough or less chips. A graham cracker crust underneath may also be a good alternative to the cookie dough.",
