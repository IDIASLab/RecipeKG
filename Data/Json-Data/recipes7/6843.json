I omitted the sugar and butter. I Used grade A Vermont maple syrup & a little organic honey. It is Healthier and sweeter than sugar so you less of it. I Used low fat milk, and added a little bit of turmeric.. helps to balance blood sugar and you can not taste it in the pie.  It was delicious!",

                "reviewBody": "Delicious! Because I made it for a meal where we couldn't use dairy I made a few modifications: Olive oil instead of butter regular deep-dish pie crust (since that was what I originally had on hand) and unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk. I also left the skin in because that's where the nutrients are. I had planned on doubling the recipe because there were nine of us for the meal but I unknowingly more than doubled the amount of sweet potatoes and ended up with enough for three pies. And it was incredible. Because no oven temperature had been called for I baked them on 350 for a little over an hour. One of the guests raved about it and I forwarded the recipe to her with the list of changes I had made. I definitely want to make this again. Thanks so much for posting!",
