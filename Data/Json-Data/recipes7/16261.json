The ingredient amounts seem way off in this one - not sure if this was intentional or an error.  I realize the cook's notes say to use more or less sugar to taste, but I can't imagine how sweet it would be using the full amount. This recipes uses 2 to 3 times what most other tembleque recipes call for.  I only used 1.5 cups of sugar and even that was quite sweet. The major problem I had was the amount of cornstarch. This recipe uses double what most recipes use. It seized up and was so thick that you could no longer whisk it, and there was no way you could pour it through a strainer, or even into the molds. I understand what the other reviewer meant by it looked like 'dough'.  It set up fine, but the cornstarch flavor took away from the coconut. I would definitely make some adjustments if I were to make this again.",
