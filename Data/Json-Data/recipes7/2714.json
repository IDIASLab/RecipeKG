A tip for everyone - put your butter in the freezer for about 15 minutes until really cold and then using the large holes on your grater, grate the butter into the flour mixture.  This makes it easier to incorporate the butter and makes a great flaky biscuit.  I will definitely make these again but with less sugar.",

I happened to have some cheddar cheese and fresh thyme on hand or I might not have made this - and I'm so glad I did - it's absolutely scrumptious. And I think I'm going to try substituting other fresh herbs for the thyme - with rosemary and then with dill. Not that the thyme isn't as good as anything needs to be - yum - but just because I think it might be equally good in other ways to go with various foods. I baked these biscuits till they were light golden brown and then put them on top of a nice heated beef burgundy stew and baked it like that for a few more minutes. Thanks for the recipe!",

When I removed the biscuits from the oven I brushed them with melted butter to which I added garlic powder and dried parsley flakes (fresh is always an option too).
