                "reviewBody": "I've tried some good biscuit recipes and some not so good.  I know what I like.  I like a biscuit that rises high and pretty, that kind of splits in half just by gently separating it with your fingers.  I like a biscuit that's light and tender and certainly not one that's kind of a grease wad (I've tried one or two of those).  This one meets all that criteria.  They're a good basic biscuit, made special with the addition of herbs.  I kind of had the feeling, however,  that these biscuits might need a little lift to ensure they  would rise as high as I would like.  I decreased the baking powder to 2-1/2 tsp. and ADDED 1/2 tsp. of baking soda.  I figured since buttermilk, which is acidic, needs baking soda it would love more than what is contained in baking powder.  I thought  a little straight sodium bicarbonate wouldn't hurt.  My suspicions proved to be correct because there was no rising issue with what came out of my oven!  I did not add kelp powder.  I did add 1/2 tsp. salt and another 1/2 tsp. sugar.  As for the herbs, I used fresh thyme along with the dried basil and parsley, although I'm confident any herbs would be good.  (Just remember you need three times  fresh herbs than dried) I did have to add a little more buttermilk to make the dough pull together.    I felt more comfortable baking these at 425* and once out of the oven I brushed them with melted butter to which I added garlic powder and dried parsley.  I loved them. They'll go great with our soup tonight!",

I took half the batch in to co-workers and they were well received there, also.  A great biscuit recipe for something savory and different, and one I would make again.",

I don't make biscuits very often bc I'm not a fan of rolling out and cutting (just one of my least favorite things) but I had milk I needed to use and these looked good.

These are pretty easy if I can get past the rolling out part, and taste quite good.  I paired with sausage gravy (another recipe on here--Drop Biscuits with Suasage Gravy, subbing these biscuits for the Drop Biscuits) and bf was pleased, although he criticized my choice to make it for dinner.
