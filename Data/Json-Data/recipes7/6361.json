I followed the recipe just as written on her blog and came out with a moist cupcake, slightly bitter filling, and a sweet buttercream that happily balanced out the ganache center.  I also went one step farther and mixed up a Bailey's Salted Caramel drizzle for the top and that took them over the top.  (For the drizzle, I used 1/2 cup caramel ice cream topping, a Tbsp of Bailey's, and salted it to taste. )  I'd definitely recommend making these!",

                "reviewBody": "So far, folks love these...a perfect Patty's Day treat. A few notes on prep: FILLING: Melting chocolate is tricky business. Heat the cream slowly on low heat but make sure it is really simmering before adding the chocolate. If you end up with a chunky, greasy mixture it means the chocolate didn't temper and you'll need to start over. FROSTING: I agree that the frosting as written isn't quite right and adding more Bailey's is not the best solution for making it fluffier. While it may seem like adding more confectioners sugar would stiffen it (like adding flour), it actually makes the frosting runnier. I increased the butter to 3/4 cup and it was perfect: both in quantity and in consistency.",

I just started getting into baking and these were very fun to make. One thing I learned is that these take a lot of time to make, especially if your a beginner.

                "reviewBody": "WOW... These were fantastic!!!!  Made cake batter according to recipe, subbing low fat sour cream & margarine for butter....it made 30 cupcakes!  Made glaze filling, subbing chocolate chips for semisweet chocolate, half & half for heavy cream, 1 tbsp. melted margarine & 1 ounce Jameson's whiskey. Carved hole in center of cupcakes, spooned in filling, then re-covered with the crust of a piece of the cut-out pieces...I recommend doing this to make frosting easier!  Made double batch of frosting with 1 stick of butter Cisco, 10 tsp Bailey's & 4 cups powdered sugar...this was more than enough to thickly frost 30 cupcakes.  These were absolutely spectacular to taste, but somewhat messy to eat. I give this one a million stars...try it, you will LOVE it!!!",

So I'll just be short a couple cupcakes and they'll look ugly. Oh well. I'll know next time to make a double batch of icing. Ganache filling is easy I skip butter and whiskey and just simmer a cup of heavy cream and pour on a bowl of 8 oz. of bittersweet chocolate. Let the cream and chocolate sit in a heat safe bowl for a minute then wisk away and it smooths right now! If you're filing cupcakes you may have some left over but dip some fruit in it and you're good!",
