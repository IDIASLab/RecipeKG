As another reviewer mentioned, though, the rice should be steamed in a bamboo basket to be truly authentic. Cooking the rice by boiling it or with a rice cooker will make it mushy and with a different consistency than intended for this recipe. Use Thai glutinous rice (different from rice that may simply be labeled \"sticky rice\"), which you can buy at most Asian grocery stores - soak it in water for a few hours or overnight, then steam in a bamboo basket (you can also purchase these in specialty stores or online - I got mine on Amazon.com). The rice will be sticky and chewy, but not mushy, meaning that the grains will hold their shape. Hope that helps!",

                "reviewBody": "Sticky rice is generally made with, well, sticky rice aka glutenous rice; but, this recipe is a great solution if you do not have sticky rice in your area, or don't have time to go to the Asian grocer. The flavor was on target. \n\nA few notes/changes:\n1. If you're using sticky rice, omit the starch. You also probably skimp a tad on cooling time.\n2. If you're using another rice (long grain, basmati), the flavor will still be good, but the rice mixture won't be as firm/sticky. Put the starch into the batch of coconut milk mixture in which you are steeping the rice in for an hour--this helps thicken it all. Cool for at LEAST an hour (keep covered), but you can leave it longer to get a little firmer. \n3. Skip the starch in the last bit of coconut milk mixture that you will pour over the top of the rice and fruit at the end.\n4. Corn starch can be used in lieu of tapioca at a 1:1 ratio. It takes a little higher temp to start thickening, but the boil seems to take care of that. \n5. Use real coconut milk, not the \"light.\"\nAlso:\n6. The ingred. measures are disjointed. I.e. you need 2 cups of coconut milk (1 can)--use 1.5 cups in the first mixture, .5 in topping. So read it through to be sure you have enough of everything.\n7. This makes a LOT  of rice. If your mangoes aren't huge, you can probably reduce the rice a bit. We had almost a third of the rice leftover.\n8. This version is very sweet, good for tart mangoes, but if yours are sweet or you like less sweet, reduce sugar by a 1/4.",

Sticky rice is a type of rice, not a style of preperation.  Authentic sticky rice is easy and fast to steam and gives this dish a chewy texture.  Next time I make it I will cut the sugar just by a little bit.  I am a fan of sweet desserts but this is a bit too much.  The sauce is not needed in my opinion.  (Besides, without the sauce you can use just one can of coconut milk without wasting part of another.)  ",

The cream is really sweet and thick on its own. I had already made the rice, so I poured half the can onto the cooked rice (enough to make it moist, but not drown the rice). I didn't add anything else--just cooked rice and cream. I'm a little worried now that this is all they do at my favorite Thai place, because it was almost as good as theirs.  Sorry this review doesn't relate directly to the recipe, but I thought it might be helpful to know that in a pinch you can get this dish with only two ingredients (technically three, since I used a little salt to cook the rice/or four if you slice a mango too).",
