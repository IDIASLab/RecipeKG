I used unsweetened coconut and loved that a hint of coconut flavor came through with no added sweetener needed. I followed the recipe exactly except for using a frozen banana. I definitely needed my high end blender for this one but it turned out to be a thick sweet smoothie that I will make again.",

I've made it two ways now: exactly as written and also with the addition of a tablespoon of creamy peanut butter - both excellent. Next time I think I'll mix granola with it and just eat it with a spoon. I guess I didn't make it exactly as written since both times I've used frozen blueberries in place of the mixed berries. No photo added but it turns out just like the picture with the recipe.",
