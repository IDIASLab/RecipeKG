But having become very health-conscious, my husband and I have been trying to replicate that chorizo flavor in extra lean ground turkey. This recipe tastes just like the pork chorizo from our favorite taco trucks. Serve in tacos, burritos, quesadillas, omelets, or breakfast burritos. I suggest serving on corn tortillas, with chopped onion and cilantro garnish, and a squeeze of lime.",

I used it to make a Picadillo recipe instead of regular chorizo which was a huge hit at our taco bar. I made it into chorizo breakfast patties that perfectly offset the sweet breakfast bread pudding I served them with. While this will never be an exact copy of the real thing the flavor profile hits most of the notes I wanted and really lends itself to adding that depth of flavor real chorizo is known for.",
