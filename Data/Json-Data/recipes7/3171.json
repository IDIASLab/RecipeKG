My ice maker doesn't really make 'cubes' per say they are a kinda half-oval shape (larger than traditional ice cubes). So...if you have similar ice - use 6 for one drink & 12 for two. Thanks for the recipe it is much easier than similar recipes where you have to buy orange juice concentrate. I always have these ingredients on hand so I'll be making it again & again!:)",

I made mine with a little more sugar a little less ice and a little Cool Whip blended into it and and dollop of Cool Whip in it and it tasted like a it had icecream in it! Yummy!

I used a fresh orange and put it through the blender first and then added the other ingredients. 1 medium size orange yielded just a bit under 1 cup. I just added water to bring it to the 1 cup mark (I doubled the recipe). I've made this twice so far and thought it was great both times. I'm on my way into the kitchen right now to make it again. I think fresh oranges are going to be a staple in my kitchen this summer.:) UPDATE: I now make this every day. This recipe is a great base for other smoothies. My kids LOVE this when I replace the ice cubes with frozen strawberries. Currently I am sipping this recipe with the addition of some fresh spinach. Delicious!",
