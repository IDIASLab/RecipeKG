We added some melted butter and a bit more milk.  Makes pretty pancakes with a hearty, grainy flavor that goes well with anything... maple syrup and cream for the kids, fruit preserves for the bigger kids, even ripe avocado with melted butter and pepper for the true health nut.  Thank you to the chef!",

I used 100% organic stone - ground buckwheat flour which was very dark. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used Greek yogurt and water using a ratio of 1:3 respectively. My batter was still a bit thick so I added a few tablespoons of milk. I think letting the batter sit helped make them tender, fluffy, and delicious! These will definitely be made often. I will never buy a mix again!",
