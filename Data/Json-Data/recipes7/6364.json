If you cook candy too fast it burns separates darkens becomes granulated and will not set. It must be stirred often.

The temps listed here are off also. 238 F is actually 114 C. The goal is to cook to the soft ball stage on a standard candy thermometer. I made these for a St. patrick's day picnic. Yum!",

I am certainly not an experienced candy/ fudge cook so I'm sure some of this went wrong due to my errors but I was pretty disappointed. The fudge never solidified even after 5 hours and time in the fridge and it did not come out the cream color as shown in the picture it was much more of a caramel color and it tastes like caramel too which covers over the flavor of the Irish cream completely. It is also MUCH too sweet for my tastes but I should have expected that with over 4 cups of sugar in the recipe!",
