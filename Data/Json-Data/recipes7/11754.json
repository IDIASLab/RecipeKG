I wonder though if you could use a high quality basalmic vinager instead of red wine vinegar? I purchased some from Italy when I visited my Daughter. It's a 5 year wooden cask cured Basalmic (which I use ONLY on something that it \"really\" matters on like this salad (the longer it's cured especially in a wooden cask makes it FAR superior to what you get at the grocers. It's expensive but what Heavenly flavor!!! I do confess though I've made croutons this way since I was a girl & my Dad would make his favorite noodle dish croutons parm. cottage cheese and noodles. I have the recipe for \"that\" dish in my A/R Recipe box again thanks to my friends the \"Buzzers\" on the A/R site (The Buzz). It's a great resource for all of us on A/R. It's complimentary with membership AND there are a boatload of nice folks on there who can answer almost any question or recipe request you can imagine and seem to love doing so!",
