By temper I mean mix a little of the whipped cream with the nutella until smooth before adding to the whipped cream do the same with the chocolate. This will give you a beautiful smooth mousse. The first time I made this I added the nutella with out tempering and my mousse looked curdled. Good Luck.",

Did make the filling exact to recipe and it was fantastic! Everyone raved about them and fought over who would get the last ones. Make sure to keep them chilled an hour into the party the whipped cream and mousse were breaking down a little. I used a decorative tip to fill the mousse in the cups and then the tip on the whipped cream can added a pretty visual along with the chocolate covered coffee bean on top. Looked like something you could buy at the Godiva store. Thanks for sharing - will definitely make again!",

                "reviewBody": "I wouldn't say these are easy or quick. It took me 3 tries to get the shells right. First I tried little silicone cups then I tried the paper bon bon cups. In both cases I couldn't get them unmolded without breaking them. Then I realized that the sides of the cups need a double coating of chocolate so I coated the insides with the 2 tsp. of chocolate refrigerated them until set then went back and added more chocolate to the sides with a butter knife and let them set again. That did the trick. I was able to unmold them with no problem (I did this with both the silicone cups and the paper liners and both worked but I preferred the shape of the silicone ones best). When incorporating the Nutella and chocolate into the whipped cream - you do need to add some of the cream to the chocolate first to smooth it out before adding it all to the cream (as suggested by mommascookin). This worked great. Because the shells took me so long to make I needed a short-cut to get these done so I ended up using canned whipped cream for the topping. I suggest adding the whipped cream hazelnuts and chocolate covered coffee bean RIGHT before serving (I didn't use the coffee beans as I didn't have any on hand) otherwise the whipped cream kind of weeps a bit even when refrigerated. Next time I will use semi-sweet or milk chocolate for the shells (just a personal preference).",
