I pulsed pretzel sticks in a food processor to crushed them (not pulverize). The smaller they are the more butter will get absorb, make a nice even crust and be less greasy. I expect these would be good with regular toll house chocolate chips if you can't find the caramel filled ones or don't want to fork out the $$, but you would be missing that something extra. Do try these if you like salty-sweet combinations.",
