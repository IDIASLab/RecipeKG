I used half that and it worked out well. I also melted the butter which I think made for easier mixing. The vanilla wafer crust was ok but not as good as the traditional graham cracker crust. I also baked the crust for about 7 minutes before adding the filling. As for the filling it s a fairly standard Key lime pie filling but with only 1 tsp. of lime zest I knew it would suffer some tartness and flavor so I upped it to 1 T. and it proved to be just right. Since it is essentially double the typical amount of filling I think it could have used another 5 minutes in the oven to fully set the filling. As for the glaze - vibrant fruity flavor pleasantly sweet and tart with a vivid ruby red color. I was torn between using it as a sauce rather than a glaze atop the whole pie and ultimately the decision was made for me. For whatever reason the glaze didn t gel as it should have and never really thickened as it cooled. It would have never worked as a glaze. Maybe my fruit pectin was too old. But it was PERFECT as a sauce and that s really how I wanted it anyway! So as it turned out I was quite pleased that it failed. This is a beautiful light refreshing spring/summer pie. I broke my own rule by serving guests a recipe I ve never tried before - and I lucked out.",
