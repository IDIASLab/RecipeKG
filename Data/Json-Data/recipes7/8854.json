Difficult to say whether that affected the outcome. Regardless the cake was completely delicious light and flavorful. Moist for a white cake as well. I used it as the base for a whipped cream and strawberry cake and it went over very well. Will make again whenever I need a white cake for anything. PS. I forgot I also added a tiny amount of lemon extract as well to enhance the strawberry flavor.",

FOLD FOLD FOLD AND DO IT GENTLY !!!! One of the reviews mentioned the cake being dense I can almost guarantee the reason for that was the way the whites were added ... you should use a plastic spatula start from the bottom of the bowl and bring the batter up from the bottom to the top  gently ... you will be able to tell a remarkably dramatic difference in the color and volume of the batter if you are too rough with it ... you will also have a dry dense unappealing cake ... hope this helps someone ... Now I am going to make this cake for my sisters birthday ... I plan to tint the batter her two favorite colors (red and black) ... ewwwww right l lol ... birthday girl gets what she wants ... I will update my review after",
