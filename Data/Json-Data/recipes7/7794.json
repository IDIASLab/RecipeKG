I replaced the applesauce with butter and the yogurt with sour cream - in other words all butter all sour cream. I don't care for the orange/cranberry flavor so I replaced the orange juice with milk. I also used coarsely chopped fresh cranberries. I loved the flavor and richness of the butter and sour cream and prefer those substitutions for the applesauce and Greek yogurt ingredients I don't generally have on hand anyway. The pecans while a suitable addition could easily be omitted and I might prefer that also. All and all a beautiful nicely domed cranberry muffin with just right sweetness and spice.",

I made no other changes. Baked at 350 my muffins were done at almost 22 minutes. I did get 12 bigger sized muffins out of a halved recipe. These muffins were very moist chewy and had a wonderful assortment of flavors that worked very well together. GREAT muffin recipe. I'd like to try this again with fresh cranberries next time and see how that works out.",

It added the perfect extra oomph to the muffins! I also used frozen cranberries instead of dried. No problem there as well. This recipe made 24 regular muffins and about 23-24 mini muffins!

I had done an ingredient search for sour cream and apple sauce with cinnamon and this muffin recipe came up. I had cooked some apples that needed to be used up and had added cinnamon! All Recipes site is sure handy. Anyway I had almost a full container of probiotic vanilla yoghurt which I needed to use up before expiry date and which equaled 2 cups and used that instead of with sour cream. The dusting of sugar and cinnamon on top the muffins sure was the icing on a cake! Wow they are delicious. Thank you.",
