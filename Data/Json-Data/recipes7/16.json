Also to the sauce I added a splash of tabasco and garnished with a sprinkling of chili powder for some extra zing (I like spicy food). The cinnamon tasted so interesting in the sauce. Next time I think I might try peach yogurt and serve it with a peach-mango chutney or something of that nature. Thanks so much for recipe chef single dad! You rock!",
