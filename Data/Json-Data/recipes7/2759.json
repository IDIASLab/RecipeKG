I didn't have any orange extract on hand, so I used 1 Tbsp of orange juice and 1 tsp of orange marmalade to ensure I got the orange flavour. Also, I halved this to test the recipe, hence the scaled down recipe called for 1/4 cup of brown and white sugar each. However, I skipped the white sugar completely and used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I ensured that the butter and sugar was beaten very very well before addng in the egg. After which I let it beat for atleast over 2-3 minutes, and then added the extracts (vanilla, OJ, marmalade) , once again beating well. I didn't use the machine to add in the flour / oats / cranberries / walnuts so that the dough wouldn't be over worked. I got 25 lovely cookies from this, although it took me 18 minutes to bake these (and they weren't dry in the least). Oh also, I ran out of pumpkin pie spice, so I used Scotdog's personal recipe for Pumpkin Pie Spice called 'Kelly's Pumpkin Pie Spice' which was simply wonderful. (I've reviewed it too). This cookie definitely beats the normal oat and raisin cookies .... a lovely new find and a fast favourite! Thanks ramie7224 for sharing this recipe with us! :D",
