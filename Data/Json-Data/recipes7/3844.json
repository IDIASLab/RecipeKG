So when I first saw this ingredient, I tried it out and it tasted so good - except it was not creamy enough for my taste. I know for a fact that substituting milk for a dessert yields to a creamier dessert so I used these substitutions from the base ingredients: 3/4 cup milk instead of water, 1/2 cup condensed milk instead of sugar, 1/2 cup of coconut milk to dissolve the cornstarch instead of water. I also used fresh adult coconuts, or niyog. Milked it first with 1 cup of tepid water for every 2 cups of coconut meat to make the \"latik\" and then 1 cup tepid water for every cup of coconut meat for the base of the maja blanca. It came out creamy but not overpowerly sweet. Added freshly grated meat of young coconuts and corn kernels to break the milky taste. INCREDIBLY GOOD!",

I used milk instead of water and cutback 25% on the sugar (1/4c on a bubble recipe) At the party I presented this at was a man from the Philippines and he said this was just about what his mother made back home. Nice compliment! He also said that quite often his mom would add a little coarse sugar to the top. He also like the creamier texture from using milk rather than the water. Next time I will use the full amount of the sugar as I felt that for a dessert it just needed a little more. Also I would use a bit more coconut on top and add some coconut extract to the mixture. Very quick and easy dessert to make. One other thing I would like to try with this recipe leave out the corn and coconut topping and add some raspberries with a raspberry puree drizzled on top! Yummy sounding??!!",

Same thing with the 3/4 cup of water I used coconut milk on it so its 1 3/4 cup of coconut milk all in all for boiling. Try this recipe and its really good!!!",
