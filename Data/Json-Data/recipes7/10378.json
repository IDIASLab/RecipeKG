These do not spread which make them a thicker cookie another plus for me. I did not add the coconut because I was out. I did add 1 tsp vanilla. Cooking temp and time is spot on.

The cookie does not expand very much in the oven so if you want a larger cookie make the dough balls bigger. Mine were a little smaller than I would have liked. Based on the other reviewer's post that the cookies were a little dry I took mine out of the oven a little earlier and they were crunchy on the outside and softer on the inside. They are definitely more like a peanut butter cookie instead of a chewy oatmeal cookie.",

I did add 2 Tablespoons of Vanilla (yes 2 tablespoons). I would have given the recipe a 5 however as written they would be on the dry side. I will be making these again with the addition of vanilla. Thanks Cheerios for this tasty treat! UPDATE: almost 12 hours of them being made..and stored in an airtight container: ive noticed they have gotten even more dry..even after my addition of the 2 tbl of vanilla.. This recipe needs more moisture..so in addition the vanilla..and few tablespoons of water(when cooking with oats) or milk should help. I like the idea of flavors in this cookie..but even more butter 3/4-1 cup would do the trick with that amount of dry ingredients.",

I read all the reviews some said the cookies were dry so I added some vanilla ( 2 teaspoons) as suggested. Even with the vanilla they were a tad dry and not as flavorful as I like a cookie to be. My husband thinks if more peanut butter was added they would be more flavorful. They were tasty but just not amazing. Edit: Ok so I put the cookies in a tupperware container last night and ate one for breakfast lol. For some reason they dont taste dry anymore and are almost a little moist. They are perfect & taste SO much better today!!",
