I substituted plain organic yogurt & coconut milk for buttermilk per Chef's suggestion (I didn't want to go to the store) & lime for the lemon due to allergies. Decreased sugar to 1 1/4c and used salted butter omitting the salt OH MY WOW!!! Used to think \"Grandma\" made the best buttermilk pie but even she could take lessons from Chef John. The undetectable substitutions and fresh grated nutmeg made an authentic rich ample 9\" deep dish buttermilk pie. There are more of your recipes than any other contributor in my favorites collection. I am NEVER disappointed! Gave pies away as Christmas gifts and all exclaimed this was better than a favorite at our local restaurant.",

I thought it was pretty good but not even close to a 5 star pie. Sorry. I used all fresh ingredients but it seemed a little too tart. I also had a very picky audience so I wouldn't take this vote as proof perfect. Wonder if it wouldn't be better with some other mix and match flavors?",
