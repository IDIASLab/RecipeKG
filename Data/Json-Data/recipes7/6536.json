Everyone loved it!  Tons of compliments on this dish, as one of the cousins said, \"it's good to have a Jew in the family!\"  Two people asked for the recipe.  FYI, I made it exactly as it is presented here.  I thought about adding raisins, and/or cornflake crumbs on top with the sugar and cinnamon, but decided to make it as-is for the first attempt at it.  I might try those changes next time.  In any case, my mother-in-law wants me to make this every year for Christmas brunch, and I'm sure I will find lots of other opportunities to make this recipe in the future.  Try it, everyone will love it!!!",

The only change I made was to add 1/2 c. of pineapple bits (drained and pressed of natural juices) and 1/2 c. of pecan bits. to the mix. If I were to do anything differently in the future it would be to double half again the sugars and cinnamon topping mix. This is definitely better cold and the next day -- it turns out like a rich custard-y cake texture. I imagine this recipe is extremely versatile and could be adapted to add/change other ingredients. I might try 1/2 f.f. plain yogurt and 1/2 sour cream next time to reduce the fat. I would not reduce the amount of sugar inside the kugel as it is just perfect. Yummy!",
