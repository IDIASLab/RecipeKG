I will say the amount of dressing is excessive (hence the 4 stars) and would be enough for way more than four servings. I scaled the dressing ingredients down to one serving and it nicely dressed two salads with a little leftover. We enjoyed this dressing very much. Mine never got what I would call creamy (maybe I wasn t whisking fast enough) but I was happy with the dressing and it s color. I didn t have arugula so I used red leaf lettuce and I just eyeballed the amounts of cantaloupe avocado and almonds. The cantaloupe I had was wonderful which added to the deliciousness of this salad. Give it a try!",
