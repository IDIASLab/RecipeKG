A few tips: I drizzled a little oil into the panko crumbs along with the salt and mixed it through, for a nice golden brown finish. Also instead of flipping I put a rack on the very bottem and the very top of my oven and just switched it halfway through. Worked like a charm! And as someone else said I needed extra panko crumbs too.",

Excuse me if that's incorrect. The recipe I made can feed a total of 27 pieces divided by 9 for each batch. Would recommend to those who crave Japanese tempura. It is also a vegetarian dish so it's good for vegetarians.",

I'll admit that I wish I would have dropped them in the deep fryer to get a more overall even brown but then that would have defeated the purpose of them being more healthy. The onions brown up the fastest so keep a close eye on them. The one problem I did find with this recipe is that you are going to need a lot more Panko than the recipe calls for so plan for that too. Overall I was happy with the way they turned out but to be honest I will drop them in the deep fryer instead of baking the next time I make this.",
