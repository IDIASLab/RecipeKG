I had one dark non stick pan and one glass pan, and the nonstick took 40-45 minutes, the glass one took an hour. I think there is a typo in the cook time because other breads I make, banana etc, take an hour. If these were made into muffins, I think the 20-25 minutes might be right. Great taste though. I added the Heath Bits along with the chocolate chips. Will make again.",
