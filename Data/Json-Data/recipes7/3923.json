To help lighten the caloric load, I used the less fat Philly Cream Cheese, and seeing as I was L-A-Z-Y and not wanting to crush oreas (why waste a perfectly good cookie?) I bought already crushed oreo crumbs. I cut the recipe in half as I didn't need a 13x9 cheesecake to eat! :) For those wanting to know the equivalent of already crushed crumbs, I used 1 3/4 Cups for an 8x8 glass pan and used 1/4 cup melted butter. I also used parchment paper versus foil (my preference). Tip-pour the melted butter in first and let it cover the entire bottom, then put the crumbs in and press down all over to make an even surface. This is about one of the easiest cheesecake recipes around! and soooooo chocolately GOOD! ;) Thanks Philly!",

One other variation was that I used the entire bag of Oreos and not just 24.  For both the semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips I used Ghiradelli brand.  ",

I did make two changes from the posted recipe: I put it in a 10-inch springform pan instead of the 9x13 pan, and I topped it with a drizzle of melted milk chocolate chips instead of using blueberries (because there just wasn't enough chocolate in it already--lol). \n\nThe springform worked great but I did have to increase the cooking time to about 1 hour. I also used the water bath method (see cheesecake tips and videos on this website) and allowed the cheesecake to cool in the oven (oven off/door cracked open) for 3 hours before refrigerating it. It turned out perfect, with no cracking at all. For the improvised topping I used a half a bag of milk chocolate chips, melted and slightly cooled, then drizzled it over the top of the refrigerated cheesecake. This would also be pretty with white chocolate.  I will definitely make this again! \n\nThis is only the second cheesecake I've ever made and it was unbelievably easy to make. If you're hesitant to try it, there's a Kraft Kitchen's video of it on YouTube. Happy baking!",
