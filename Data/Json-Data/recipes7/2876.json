Instead of the water I used a 46oz can of tomato juice.  (we like our chili more soupy rather than stewy and I think it added the flavor that it needed)   I also garnished each bowl with a dollop of sour cream.  My family loved it.  Especially my husband who loved the flavor.  Will definitely be making this a lot this winter.",

Omitted the sugar and added some balsamic vinegar for acidity. It was good however i did miss the green chilies that I normally put in chili. I also missed the garlic so I added a few tbsp of minced garlic plus garlic powder. The cinnamon was a surprising addition that we all liked. Thanks!",
