Will definitely use this one again:)",

The addition of real bacon can also be a kicker! Excellent recipe. Thank-you",

Adjustments: - Add 1/2 pound more ground beef (I use 96% lean) - MUST USE Brooks Hot and Spicy beans - amazing. - 1 bottle of Negra Modelo beer. - Use all seasonings and spices listed but heap them or adjust to your liking. - Cook for at least 3 hours. There will be a lot more liquid because of the beer and Brooks beans so plan on adding at least two more hours of cook time -- TOTAL of 3 hours -- but you could go longer on low heat. Wipe off excess moisture on the saucepan cover when stirring to speed up the process. I promise it won't disappoint.",
