It will allow you to tailor some of the ingredients more to your taste. There have been many variations of this liqueur, but this one is the most accurate to store brands of Irish cream. It is also the most flexible. Store brands do not use Hershey's&reg; chocolate syrup in their recipe. This one should have a better consistency and taste a little more proper to the famous brand 'B' from Ireland if followed directly. You be the judge.",

People put it on ice cream angel food cake in hot cocoa coffee and drank it straight. I never have sweetened condensed milk or chocolate syrup on hand so I appreciated that I could make this entire recipe without buying special ingredients. Only change I didn't have Irish whiskey so I used Kentucky whiskey. I will make this again. I did not put the coconut in by the way.",
