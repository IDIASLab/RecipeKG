                "reviewBody": "Growing up in Colorado my mom made this all of the time. She made the mix in bulk and used Tang instead of real orange juice. I hadn't had it in years and when I saw this recipe I knew I must try it. Pineapple though? Not only is that a flavor I don't care for it was never in the Russian tea I knew. I was skeptical so I bought the smallest container I could find. I scaled the recipe in half and that was just about right. Loved the flavor the real orange juice gave it but as suspected I did not like the pineapple at all. I'm still giving this 4 stars because using real OJ was excellent. If you like pineapple flavor I highly recommend you give this one a try. Replacing the pineapple with OJ would be too much orange but for us non pineapple lovers there has got to be something to use instead. Club soda maybe? I drank this hot as I did when I was a kid but am anxious to try the leftover cold. If the pineapple flavor mellows overnight I'll update my review. Until then this was pretty good.",
