Turn off heat and add vanilla. Then with a wooden spoon beat it for about 2 minutes until it starts to shine.  This also helps to cool it a little.  Then spread over green layer and chill.  Hope that helps!!",

The one thing I did do is put each layer in the freezer for just a few minutes before putting in the fridge for 30 minutes. I think that this helped keep the layers defined from each other. If you haven't tried these...YOU NEED TO! This will definately become a regular in our house! Thanks Cher for sharing such a great recipe!!!",

I melted 2 ounces of semi sweet chocolate 1/3 cup butter and 4 TBL of light whipping cream in a double broiler. Once melted I took off heat and added about 3/4 cup powdered sugar. I then put the bowl with the mixture in it in a bowl of ice and whipped it. The end product is a fluffy fudge frosting. It was a massive hit. They were gone within 2 minutes! It sounds complicated for the frosting but well worth it and reall not that hard.",

Yes I'm a guy...that cooks...and has done the Fire Station competitive cooking gigs with my fellow firefighters for over 25 years...and THIS DESSERT IS CRAZY MAD GOOD...and when I prepared this browie for friends and loved ones after a cautious sampling these super rich and multi-flavored brownies are GONE! To tell you the truth...I truly do not understand why various reviewers are having issues with preparing this dessert. I followed the instructions that Cher provided to the tee...as I always do with recipes I find just find to have a starting point from which to make my own changes later on... and I had zero issues; and it comes out great each time. There are a couple of suggestions that I will make for your consideration: The middle mint layer...I prefer a thicker layer as the instructions will only make for a thin layer...I make about 20% more. Then the top layer...My first attempt to melt the butter with the chocolate as directed resulted in scorched butter as it melts far faster than the chocolate melted...put the butter in when the chocolate is 1/2 melted. Lastly halve the vanilla in the top layer...unless you REALLY like how it makes the layer taste. I found 1 Tbs of vanilla very over powering... Change the flavoring extract and food coloring to make this WOW dessert work for any occasion...even a Fire Station Dessert Cook Off... lol... Enjoy...",

                "reviewBody": "These have got to be the richest the most decadent brownies I ever tried...I couldn't cook these in a 9 x 13 pan. I'm in an RV and that size of pan will not fit in my oven so I baked in a 9 x 9 pan instead...I think I'll wait to make these again when I have a regular sized oven because they were so thick and chocolatey and rich...I should have cut them into 1-inch squares rather than regular brownie size pieces. I imagine I wouldn't need a quart of milk if they were a little thinner..I gave this recipe 4 stars because it is incredibly sweet..I only used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar in the green frosting and I really think that was too sweet I couldn't imagine using the full 4 cups (by-the-way I burned my hand mixer up making this recipe...LOL!). I think the next time I make these I would probably cut the confectioner's sugar down even more! These are super delicious...time consuming but totally worth the effort...thanks for a great recipe!",
