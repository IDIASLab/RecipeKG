I added salt to the batter after tasting the first crepe.  For the sweet crepes I used oranges, apples Grand Marnier, honey, walnuts, vanilla, cinnamon and Greek yogurt, all mixed together and rolled cigar style.  For the savory crepes I cooked Russian banana potatoes with shallots and tarragon.  I made a thin dressing of Greek yogurt, milk, honey, and Dijon style mustard.  I filled the crepes with arugula, potatoes, feta, chopped pistachios and a drizzle of dressing.  I used an open envelope style to showcase the ingredients and pooled more dressing on the side.  Both ways were wonderful.  I got 6 - 9 inch crepes from this recipe.  Thanks cultmovieguy!",

After cooking I rolled some of the oranges right into the pancakes. These were sweet enough that I felt the cinnamon sugar mix was not needed! Next time I will add the cinnamon into the batter. This is a great recipe and I will be making these again with my tweaks!",
