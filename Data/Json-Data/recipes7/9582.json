Great for those chocolate cravings and there is nothing in the house kinda fix. I think I have it down. Add a drop of vanilla ,use canola oil and top with chips such as chocolate or caramel. Let sit for several minutes and top with vanilla ice cream. This is a gooey chocolate wonder! Thanks so much for sharing this delight!",

It was very easy to make and does fit perfectly into a standard size mug. However I found it to taste more like warm chocolate flavored flour with sweetener than the brownie I was looking forward to. I was very disappointed. It's a great idea, but the final product just does not live up to its full pan counterpart.",

If you're expecting traditional brownie taste/texture you'll probably be disappointed but c'mon this is a 100 second microwave recipe!!! I took the other reviewers' recommendations and did not use olive oil - I used butter instead. I also added a splash of vanilla extract. When it was done I took a taste and was immediately impressed. It was slightly crumbly so I poked holes in the top with a chopstick and drizzled half and half over it. To die for!!!! The next time I made it I only cooked it for 1 min 30 secs and that was perfect. I've also drizzled cream over top if I don't have half and half. So good! Thanks for the great recipe Tankyy!",
