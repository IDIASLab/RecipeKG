I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter but used a bit less butter and also a little less sugar.  I think it would be just as good if not better with half the sugar.  I also added less cinnamon, added a few shakes of salt, and just a tad of cornstarch/water mixture... about a teaspoon cornstarch to about a tablespoon water, and this thickened the mixture a bit without making it gloppy or pasty.  I want to make this every day for the next few weeks it was so good!",
