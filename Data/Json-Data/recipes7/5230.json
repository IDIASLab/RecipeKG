I soaked my corn first in cold water with a bit of sugar and salt for about an hour inside the husks (peeling back the husk a bit and removing a bit of the silk then putting the husk back). I put the corn in husks on the grill for 30 minutes rotating it around the coals. The corn cooks by steaming inside the husks. I softened the butter and added the rest of the ingredients. I cut the amount of pepper in half and added 1 tsp. of smoked paprika and 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper vs. adding the hot pepper sauce as I thought it might be a little too hot for us. All that was left to do was break out the napkins and eat. These definitely are a garlic lover's dream - sweet, spicy and delicious!",

I tweaked it similar to what Jill did by soaking the corn and grilling it with the husks! Instead of using the seasoned butter on the corn AFTER it was cooked, I peeled back the husks and brushed it on and then I relpaced the husks and grilled on low flame for 30 minutes...turning constantly! The husks will flame up while grilling, but thats what gives the corn that great smokey flavor! I didn't use the lime juice because I didn't have any. I will use this recipe for grilled corn from now on!",
