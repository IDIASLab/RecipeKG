Summer peach season will be coming to an end soon, and this was a good way to bid it farewell until next year.  ***UPDATE 6.14.19:  Had peaches to use up, I was out of vanilla, so I used almond extract instead which was equally good.

After baking for 35 minutes I switched my oven to broil and kept an eye on it just to brown up the top nicely. I just tried a piece still warm with a bit of whipped cream on top. So so so good! Vanilla ice cream would be great with it too. I might skip the nutmeg and bump up the cinnamon next time though just as a personal preference. Thanks for the recipe!",

I had 5 large almost too ripe peaches so I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 12 glass pan no cooking spray so I used a bit of butter. It turned out somehow that I had no vanilla no cinnamon or nutmeg so I used about a quarter of a teaspoon of almond extract and powdered ginger. Because of the lack of spices I chopped a half cup of pecans and added them to the topping for an added crunch. This turned out very well and satisfied my craving for both peach cobbler and pecan pie",
