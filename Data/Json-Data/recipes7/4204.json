I used frozen berries and only 1 large banana; I used about half the sugar and I didn't have wheat gluten so I used cornstarch (probably not enough b/c it ended up soupy...but still yummy). Also I only had 1 crust so I just served with whipped cream on top - it was DELISH! I think next time I'll do it the same way but add walnuts on top before baking...just to add a little crunch.",
