The sugar should be cooked on low, cooking it too fast or too hot will cause it to carmelize.  I start on low and ramp it up to nearly medium over the course of an hour and my glass comes out nice and clear.  It's a time commitment, but there's really no way to rush sugar.  This a fun recipe that will get you kudos every time though!",

I varied the cupcakes however:  after I baked them, I cut cone shaped holes and filled them with cherry pie filling. I placed the little topper back on and iced the top of the cupcake. This made it so when you bit into the cupcake, it was also \"bleeding\" and blood filled. The cherry and dark chocolate flavor goes together well!\n\nThe hardest part is making the \"glass\", which I had nooo experience with that type of cooking. After spending a long time at the stove (I also didn't have a candy thermometer) I was able to get the sugar mixture the right consistency. The glass effect is really creative!\n\nAlso I had a hard time making the \"blood\" sauce the right consistency, so I just used red gel icing.\n\nI loved this recipe and enjoy the odd side of cupcake making ;)",

Only used this recipe for the glass and blood.  The glass recipe is fantastic - don't change a thing!  Boiled the mixture to 300* and poured it in a parchment lined jelly roll pan which ended up making the glass the perfect thickness.  Let it cool, removed from the pan, covered with another piece of parchment and hit it with a hammer.  It shattered like real glass!!  As for the blood, I did not add any water at all and I'm glad I didn't as I think it would have been way too watery.  The consistency is perfect without water.  Also, only used one drop of blue color.  For 12 cupcakes, I'll cut the glass and blood recipes in half next year as I have alot leftover.  Update:  Store in refrigerator. Otherwise, glass melts overnight and no longer looks good.",

The fake blood was very quick and super easy to make. I liked how it had a realistic blood color. Make sure to have a red food coloring with a topper that will allow drops of the color. Mine was a large bottle and I had to guess. Luckily I got it right. For the glass I would seriously make it the day before and just leave the pieces separted on the sheet pan on the counter. It takes a long time to try to make the same day. The fake blood also thickens up nicely if it is put in the fridge overnight anyhow. To make the glass candy a very reliable thermometer is neccessary. I also highly suggest a large sheet pan with a silpat that fits. The liquid glass will not stick to the silpat sheet and will peel off. It took I would guess 30-45 minutes to reach 300 deg. I didn't time it but it seemed about that long. I started it on medium and slowly moved it up to a temperature of 8. Splattering sugar is very hot so I did it more slowly. It will take a couple of hours at least to fully harden too. It broke real easy with a hammer. If I made them again I might divide the sugar liquid. It is real thick about 1/4\" at least. It has to be sucked on like a lollipop it can't be bitten at that thickness. Either way I thought the affect looked rather real. TY",

And I tried making the blood 5 or 6 times and it never came out to the right color or consistency. It just wouldnt stick to the glass as it ran down and it did turn out too dark or even purple. I found the best thing was to just drop the red food coloring right on the glass it it comes out perfect! Instead of cupcakes I used frosten brownies and everyone liked them so much more!",
