She always used shortening instead of margarine and pecans instead of walnuts chopped fine. I have made them with butter flavor shortening which I really prefer. I also made them with butter but really prefer the shortening. My husband is diabetic so this is his \"treat\" at Christmas. His mother passed away many years ago so I feel sure it brings back good memories.",

The cinnamon can be over-powering to someone who doesn't care for a lot of spice. The nice thing with these cookies is that cinnamon can be substituted for something else or eliminated all together. If cinnamon is too strong I suggest a spice combo such as allspice nutmeg ginger and cinnamon. I would use ginger the least (no more than 1/4 to 1/2teaspoon) until you know how it will taste in this recipe. Sometimes my grandmother omitted cinnamon and the nuts and used an extract...lemon for example. If you use an extract use carefully as you are adding extra liquid to the batter.",
