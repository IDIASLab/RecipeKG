I did not de-seed the serranos. Also I used a small white onion and 2 big cloves shallots in place of the red onion as I didn't have any. Also omitted cardamom as I didn't have them too. Used cinnamon powder instead of stick. Skipped the sugar and didn't miss it. Although it sounds like I changed it by quite a bit but I think only the chile pepper made a more significant difference. Love this dish and would definitely make it again - with and without the adjustments. Thank you for a recipe that reminded me of home...",
