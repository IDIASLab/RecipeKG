Personally I think you'd be better off if you did just the roast & shredded it to be used with tortillas.  It took forever to cook in the slow cooker also. We started on a med setting cause we were going to be gone so would turn down then to low. When we got home it still wasn't tender so turned the crock pot up to 3 1/2. Got done doing those errands & checked out the roast. Nope, turned up to 4 our of a possible 5 & finished errands to come home to it bubbling nicely. All the cooking time came to 8 hours using overall med temp.",
