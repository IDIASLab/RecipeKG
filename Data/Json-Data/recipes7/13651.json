This was very easy to put together and looked so pretty when it was done (though mine did crack a bit). I served each piece with a drizzle of chocolate sauce whipped cream and additional crushed peppermint candies. This would be wonderful for any winter gathering or just anytime you want a quick and easy but very tasty cheesecake which is why I made it lol! I will def be making this again YUM!!!!
