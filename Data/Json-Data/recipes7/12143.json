I tripled the helpings of herbs and next time and there will be a next time. will use fresh garlic at least two cloves. With the green pepper flavor might add cumin. Recipe said to peel squash which was impossible due to hard shell. Split and put in microwave until just able to spoon out and then cut meat in 3\" pieces. Took 8 to 10 minutes in microwave. It was unbelievably good and my husband loved it. And incredibly easy. Gave a four as I had to add a lot.",

I agree with the comments about not enough liquid - but then again what is 12 oz of spaghetti squash? The average squash is 2-3# so was the intent 1/4 of a squash? I used a whole medium squash, 2 large chicken breasts and 4c chicken stock.  Plus a bay leaf for extra seasoning.  Next time I'll start with onion, celery and carrot like all good soups have.  Not bad though, and definitely healthy!",

I cut mine in half and put it in the microwave for 8 minutes and then was able to easily scoop it out. I just put the chicken in first (whole breasts not diced) put the squash on top and then poured everything over it. I used a full can of chicken broth but did not add any extra liquid beyond that. I used generous amounts of all the seasonings. When we were ready to serve I shredded the chicken breasts. Topped with Parmesan cheese. Very good.",
