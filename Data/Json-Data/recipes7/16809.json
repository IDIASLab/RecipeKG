I followed all the directions and was very disappointed that it was the consistency of pudding to the touch when it was \"finished\". Figuring it was ruined I decided to try using the manual setting for 10 minutes. What could I loose right? Imagine my surprise when it still felt like pudding. I decided to go for broke and try one more time for 15 minutes. It was still like pudding. So I figure I'll throw it out when I clean up the kitchen after dinner. About an hour later I go to throw it out and notice that the sides have pulled away from the pot a bit. I'm not gonna lie I got a little excited. I pulled a knife out and when around the edges and flipped it onto a plate just like the directions said fully expecting to here a plop of pudding consistency lies. Instead I got an almost perfect cake. I say almost perfect because the bottom was scorched from being heated so much but the rest of the cake is perfect. It reminds me of a reine de saba with consistency and flavor. Next time I fully intend to let it sit in the pot before heating more.",
