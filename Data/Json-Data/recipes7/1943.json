Using flour as a binder is rather popular with more traditional Lithuanian recipes as are kugels made with broccoli and potatoes. Using a starchy vegetable matzoh meal and flour are all ways to skip using noodles in a kugel recipe. As for this one I've never seen or heard of a 7\"x 11\" baking dish so I used an 8\"x8\" dish made sure that I placed the baking dish on a sheet pan for extra insulation and baked it @ 350F. I used a can of pumpkin pur\u00e9e (not pumpkin pie filling!) as my squash and covered it for the first 30 minutes of baking. No problem! The kids loved it and they were all stoked to have 'pumpkin pie squares' to eat along with dinner.",
