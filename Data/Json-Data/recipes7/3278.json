We ARE deer camp. my tips--- SIMMER for 2-3 hours!!!  put as much back in the gallon jugs after its finished. very easy to store in fridge and then just a screw cap on it. BUT make it a week or two ahead of time! then put 3 sticks in each gallon jugs and let it sit in the fridge- every couple days shake them up. this way you wont even taste the everclear- if you make it right you wont even know it has alcohol in it. the longer it sits the less alcohol you wil taste. as i dont like hard alcohol i make it early so i can celebrate a downed deer with my husband and all his friends! OH- and make SURE you have a big funnel-- that two bucks at walmart will prevent you from moping a huge mess up in the kitchen. good luck and enjoy!!",
