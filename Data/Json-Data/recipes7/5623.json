I have to say although galangal sounds exotic enough to not be found easy through most groceries store it is definitely worth getting. It is so aromatic and adds so much flavor to the larb! I would have to say the first time allowing all of the juices to evaporate in the 3rd step made the chicken too dry. The second time as soon as i finished seasoning the ground chicken with the shrimp paste fish sauce and sugar (and crab paste just because i was curious) I added the lime juice mint and basil right away. The 2nd time turned out alot juicier and my whole laotian house was happy. You can't mess this recipe up! Authentic and delicious! Thanks Nana!",

You can also buy already ground rice at most asian markets and then you just brown it up. If you can get thai peppers, that makes a difference. Once the chicken, pork, lamb is cooked, you add the rice, thai peppers, shallots, green onion, fish sauce, lime juice to taste and cilantro. We always serve with cabbage leaves or over rice. It is sooo good and really easy to make. Also good served cold.",

I upped the chili peppers a bit since I'm an insatiable chili fiend but it had that perfect blend of hot/sweet/sour/salty/aromatic that I've come to associate with Southeast Asian food. And even with all the flavors the fresh herbal quality really shone. I ate it mixed with leaf lettuce over rice with cucumber spears on the side and I can honestly say that I could eat this every day and never tire of it. (Galangal isn't available in my area so I substituted half the amount of ginger and a quarter the amount of fennel seed since to me galangal has vague licorice notes.)",
