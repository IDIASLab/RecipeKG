I expected it to be sweet and complex in flavors and texture and that's exactly how it turned out. I used beef instead of lamb but everything else I followed exactly. I looked at some images of bobotie online and saw that most people decorated the top with bay leaves so I did that and also added some fo the almonds on top. We liked this dish. I made it with Indian Rice Pilaf from this site and it went well with it. When I make this again, I will get rid of the liquid that the meat rendered once it was cooked and before pouring the milk/egg mixture on top. It came out a bit watery because of that liquid.",
