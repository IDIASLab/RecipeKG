In fact he said the fact that it went down so quickly speaks for itself in terms of his \"review\" for AR. Because it included ice cream rather than yogurt it was already a positive for me as I don't care for the tang of yogurt in smoothies. As for Hubs he simply appreciated it for something different than the typical yogurt-based smoothie. I don't use soy milk I'm afraid so I used regular milk with a dribble of of vanilla a premium quality vanilla gelato all frozen strawberries and a good-sized ripe and juicy peach. My Vita-Mix took care of any peach peels or strawberry seeds handily but I'm curious how a regular household blender would do on those peels. This is creamy refreshing pleasantly sweet with equally balanced flavors of the strawberries and peaches. Hubs found this quite filling so unfortunately (for me anyway) I don't think I'll be making our Saturday morning breakfast! As the first reviewer of this smoothie recipe discovered because of an ingredient search for smoothies using peaches I can happily rate this a hit..with BOTH of us.",
