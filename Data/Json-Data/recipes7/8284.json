Baked at 350 these were done at 25 minutes. I did have to cover them halfway with foil so they did not burn on top.

I had pudding mix loose in a container so I just used a tablespoon since several people said it was fine without. I didn't have chocolate chips so I cut up some chocolate bars. I didn't use the full amount of chocolate and I think these would be delicious with or without them. I made them as mini-muffins and they took about 12-14 minutes in my oven. I also made some with liners and some without. Make them! They're awesome!",
