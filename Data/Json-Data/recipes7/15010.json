I also added a half tsp of almond extract to bump up the flavor.  Might try a splash of Amaretto next time instead?  For the add ins: I used approximately 2 cups each of chocolate chunks, coconut and sliced almonds. The dough is hard to resist. I noticed as the dough warmed up the cookies spread more, stuck more and browned unevenly. So I chilled the dough a bit and used parchment paper. Perfectly chewy thick cookies.
