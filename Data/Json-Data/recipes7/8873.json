My husband is Lebanese and This is a staple in our household. I use 2 regular sized cans of green beans, one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce. First saute a decent amount of onions in olive oil, then add your canned tomatoes and green beans. I season it generously with my own spice blend that I make using 1tbls. cinnamon, 1.5 tsp salt, 1 tsp nutmeg, .5 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp allspice.  As another reviewer suggested,  you can add lamb or ground beef as well. but we keep this vegetarian typically. I serve it over rice and vermicelli pilaf.  So delicious!!",

I added a bag of frozen cut green beans ( Romano are the best but hard to find where I am). Once they change color I add a can of herbed diced tomatoes salt and pepper to taste and more cinnamon. I also add half a can of rinsed chickpeas for protein. Let simmer 15 mins to the flavours can meld. You can serve this warm or have it cold just add more olive oil to your liking.",
