I've been looking for a recipe that was quick and easy this one was perfect.  So, Yummy with my coffee Easter moring. I dld make some spice changes.  I used cinnamon instead of apple pie spice and changed the butter to low cal butter sub.  I cut each biscuit in four pieces.  I put six pieces in each muffin cup. And as a Weight Watcher each muffin was only 1 1/2 points.  This was so good it truly reminded me of a \"REAL\" cinnamon roll from the donut shop.    Thanks Lindsay. great idea.",

Because the recipe made twelve \"muffins\", I had to double the rest of the ingredients. This was good, though next time I'll just do what I usually do with monkey bread and dip the ball in butter and roll in the sugar/spice blend. I did make a cream cheese drizzle for the top of these which the boys flipped for. It took a little more time with a homemade bread dough but the outcome was great. The kids especially liked these. NOTE: I used my small cookie scoop for this and made three balls in each muffin tin, just like I did for making Cloverleaf Rolls.",

I cut the biscuits into six pieces and put 3 pieces in each... I was short 12 pieces so I had to cut up 2 more biscuits from another can and I just doubled the spice sugar mixture. I put my pieces into a plastic bowl and put a top on it so all I had to do was shake it around and the pieces were coated. I added a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the butter mixture while it was cooking and spooned it on. Took eight minutes to bake and is absolutely wonderful!

I read through most of the reviews and used a lot of their suggestions from those reviews. I used the Grands Original (16 oz) which meant I needed to tweak the measurements for the mixture you rolled the pieces in. I also used a ziploc bag to get all the pieces covered completely (one biscuit cut up at a time). I used the apple slicer someone else suggested putting 6 of those covered pieces in each liner. I was sure not to over fill the those liners with the sugar mixture by using a spoon to drizzle it on and making sure all the pieces were covered somewhat (because one review said it all pooled at the bottom). I reduced my temp to 350 degrees as someone else suggested and ended up extending the time by 2 min increments (total of 16 mins) until they were done on top and sprung back as the recipe calls for. We shared one to make sure they were done all the way through and I must say we all gave them two thumbs up.",

My grandchildren all want to bake monkey muffins when they come over.  We use Grands muffins.  They are large so we cut them into 8 to 10 pieces. I cut the pieces.  They put them in a covered tupperware bowl. Shake, Shake, Shake.  Then they put them in the muffin tins & I finish them off. They put them in the oven.  I take them out & they are so proud of themselves.  If there are no parents around we make up little gift bags for them to take home for a surprise for Mommy & Daddy.  At Christmas time they wanted to make some for their teachers.  For the apple pie spice mix I use:\n4 tsp cinnamon\n2 tsp nutmeg\nThere is an \"Apple pie spice\" recipe on this site & that one calls for 1 tsp cardamon.  This is a spice which I never have on hand & the recipe tastes just has good w/o it.  Have Fun!!!!",
