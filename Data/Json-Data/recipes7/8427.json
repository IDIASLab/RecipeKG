You are correct the dish didn't look appetizing so not many touched it at first but when they realized that it did taste better than it looked there was none left over. I did send my family the video on youtube so they could find instructions and the recipe. I used white mushrooms because that was what I had on hand and canned corn. This year I all be using frozen corn and the porcini mushrooms. Thank you so much for the accidental deliciousness I will be making it for church potluck on thanksgiving and also for our family thanksgiving dinner.",

And pro tip: the first time I made it I left it in the oven as long as the recipe says. The second time I shaved off about 8 minutes and I thought it was even better! Was a little more moist. Wow! What amazing flavor. Perfect for the holidays, goes great with any protein. ***tip: if making for holiday meals with gravy, save the delicious porcini water, strain it through some paper towels through a fine mesh strainer  to get rid of the grit that sometimes comes out of the mushrooms, and use it in your gravy!",

I didn't find that. Mine had a nice browned crust. I let it sit for about 30 minutes (cornmeal holds heat well) and it didn't fall apart when I used a spoon to serve.
