I\u2019d give this 5 stars for concept and flavor and I\u2019ll probably make it again. But I gave it only 4 stars for ingredient amounts and method. The flour and the cracker mixtures were very skimpy amounts to bread 4 steaks. I also hate it when canned goods are called for in uneven can amounts. Instead I used a whole 15 oz. can to avoid having leftover tomato sauce and adjusted my spices. I\u2019ve found that even though cube steaks are tenderized at the market they are still a fairly chewy piece of meat. I followed the baking method in this recipe as stated. Next time I will bake the browned cube steaks longer with the sauce poured over them and covered with foil so they \u201cstew\u201d a bit for added tenderizing. Then melt the cheeses on top.",

I did change a few things, didn't have crackers, so breaded it flour/garlic salt combo, egg and then italian seasoned bread crumbs which works well with the recipe anyways.  As per another reviewer, when baking the already fried steaks, I put them in a baking dish sprayed with pam, and poured store bought spaghetti sauce over the top, covered with foil and baked for 20 minutes.  Placed thick slices of mozzarella on top of the sauce and baked for 10 minutes longer, served on top of spaghettini...very good and fairly easy.",

I will make it again, but I will change a few things.\n\nFor starters, I didn't think the cubed steak got tender enough, so it needs to be cooked longer.  I will probably brown it the same way, pour the sauce on, cover and cook for an hour or more.\n\nSecondly, I would use a marinara sauce or pasta sauce instead of plain tomoato sauce.  There wasn't enough flavor for me in the tomato sauce, even with the basil & sugar.\n\nMy husband works for a tomato company, so I'm pretty used to spicy, flavorful sauce and this didn't do it.  Even my dh complained about that a little and thought it would be better with a jarred spaghetti sauce.\n\nHowever, it smells fabulous and with a few alterations, I can see this being a 7 star recipe!\n\nP.S.  I also didn't like the cheese on the top, but that is just me.  My 3 year old daughter loved it.",

They had the same bumpily appearance as a cube steak so I used them. The browning process cooked them through so I didn't have to bake them. I used panko instead of saltine crackers for the breading and an eight ounce can of tomato sauce with a can of diced tomatoes for the sauce. These came out great. I'll try it with beef cube steaks when I'm allowed to buy new meat.",
