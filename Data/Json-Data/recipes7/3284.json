When visiting family in Hawai'i, I am on a constant search for the wiggly, creamy goodness found in this coconut treat.  When I decided to do a mini Hawaiian feast last night, I knew I had to include haupia...I found this recipe, tried it out and OMG I'm so thrilled!  The flavor is spot on, the texture perfect.  I'm in heaven!  BTW, the quality of the coconut milk you use makes all the difference.  If it doesn't taste awesome out of the can, it's not going to taste good in haupia.  I've tried no less than 10-15 different brands and have only found one that I like.",

Now the other day bf and I got together and made a mini-feast of lau lau limu poke lomi salmon and of course poi. At the end even though we were stuffed.. we both felt something was missing but couldn't quite figure it out. Then we realized--HAUPIA!! To make up for that I searched for recipes online and decided on this one because there was salt in it (salt makes desserts have depth and not taste like you're eating a sugar cube). The only tweak I made to the recipe was that I used half white sugar and half coconut palm sugar. It got thick really fast when I was making it so I thought I did something wrong but I just kept mixing it over low heat until it was completely smooth. Let it chill for a couple hours and voila--homemade haupia. I thought this was really delicious and rich and creamy--just like tutu used to make. BUT the bf said that while the flavor was good it wasn't 'gelatinous' enough for him. I guess he likes the mass-produced-from-envelope style in the restaurants better. To each his own but I love it! Thanks!",
