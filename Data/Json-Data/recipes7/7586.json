It took the entire batch of sugar cookie dough to cover my pizza pan but turned out perfectly. Then I chose not to use the glaze on the fruit as I didn't want to add the extra sweet. It was a good choice - it tasted fine without it and the fruit did not turn. (It was about 6 hours from when I sliced it to when we ate it.) I will make this again!",
