People this is not a chili dog recipe. No chili powder should ever come near this recipe and it should not taste like you opened a can of that foul chili stuff made by Armour. This is a sweet recipe that covered coney dogs at the root beer drive-in when I was a little girl (45-50 years ago). \n\nGrandpa you rock! This is the recipe I've been trying to find for the last three decades. I followed the recipe to the letter and tasted it and thought oh no this is disgusting. I went ahead and added the cooked hamburger/onion mixture and plugged the crockpot in on low. To my utter delight what I tasted two hours later was a trip down memory lane. This is the holy grail of coney dog recipes. My family ate every bite of this recipe and clamored for more. I will be making another batch for 4th of July festivities and I will be adding it to all summer holidays. I can't wait to feed it to guests and extended family members who can reach back to the days when coney dogs ruled the drive ins! Thank you so much.",
