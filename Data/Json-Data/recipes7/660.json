These turned out great although my first batch really only made eleven cookies. I had plenty of frosting left over so next time I think I ll double the dough. I will say I think these tasted better the next day after they had time to set. The description says they re a very spicy cookie I would say not so much but I love extremely spicy food. The only confusion I had with the recipe itself was it called for 1/4 cup milk if needed and the directions never said when to add it in. I assumed it went in the frosting. My frosting was also a lot thicker than the one other picture.",
