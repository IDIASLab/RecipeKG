I had to find out for myself! I agree with The Messy Cook wholeheartedly - this is a very nice bread with great raspberry/lemon flavor and the reviewer for whom this bread didn't rise probably didn't use self rising flour - or maybe it was OLD self rising flour. I left out the nutmeg and nuts and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla for heightened flavor.  I couldn't have been more pleased. It's moist, pretty with its flecks of zucchini and dots of raspberry, and the amount of cinnamon is just right.  With zucchini so in season now, I hope others will give this recipe a try. It certainly is worth more than the 3-star rating it has right now. Great recipe reedfamilyof5!",
