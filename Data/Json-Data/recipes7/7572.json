From what I can tell the syrup is disagreeing with being baked! It hasn't fallen over the side or anything it's literally smoking RIGHT IN THE PAN. Maybe I should have known better (?) but I've never made anything that baked with syrup. It eventually stopped smoking (about 35 minutes into the baking ack!) but geeze a little warning would have been nice! It was really easy to construct together. I used a home-made dough instead of store bought (couldn't find any and I was making regular loaves anyway so I just snagged some of that dough). The cinnammon sugar didn't really want to stick on the dough but I just sprinkled some on once I had a layer down to make sure it wasn't lacking. The syrup was pretty easy to make. I eventually had to bake it a lot longer (past 45 minutes; I stopped keeping track). This might have been the dough I was using though. Now that it's all done it LOOKS delicious. The negative stars are mostly due to smoke. I'll update tomorrow after my family tries it and I know if it was any good!",

So I used only 1 stick of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar but I still found that there was plenty of \"gooeyness\" throughout when the bread was finished. I cut each loaf of bread into 18 pieces (36 total). Ironically when I got done cutting the cream cheese I also had 36 pieces. So all of my bread pieces had filling. I have a 9.75 inch bundt pan that I used. I made this the night before and when it was assembled I covered it in greased plastic wrap and put it in the fridge overnight. I expected it to rise some in the fridge but I was pleasantly surprised that it had risen completely after 9 hours! I took it out and let it come to room temp while I preheated the oven and it was done in probably 45 minutes. A nice way to enjoy Easter breakfast without any last minute hassle. We served it with the hard boiled eggs the kids had colored (after they had to find them all of course). I just wish I had about 5 other people to share it with because there is no way on earth we could come close to eating this all. I like to eat but my insides would not have been happy if I had eaten more than I did:)",
