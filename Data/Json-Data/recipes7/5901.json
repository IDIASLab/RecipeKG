These muffins turned out so good! Just the right amount of sweetness, perfectly moist, very flavorful. My sons and I really liked the combination of the blueberries and applesauce. Out of 12 muffins, there's two left. My sons ate most of them up this morning!",

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very well.  I love that these taste like muffins and not cake.  I got 18 muffins, not 12.  If I had filled the muffin cups fuller, I could have gotten the 12 as stated in the recipe.  But it would have been nearly to the very top of the tin, and I didn't think you should fill them that much.  Next time I make them (maybe tomorrow) I will see what happens when I put all the batter in 12 muffin cups.  Usually I try to make a recipe healthier, but this one is great as is!!  (And I do love sweets, so this isn't coming from someone who only eats \"healthy\" food).  My 3 year old also loves them.  Thanks Rebecca, for sharing your recipe!  Oh, and as a side note I grind my own whole wheat flour and then put it in the freezer...so it is more fresh than what you can buy at the store.  I don't know how much that has to do with how great these turned out.  Oh, one more thing!  I only had frozen blueberries, so I just added them right from the freezer.  They were not fully frozen but that's because my freezer doesn't work very well. :)\nUPDATE: I made these again this morning and only made 12.  The cups look more like 3/4 full, but they rose nicely and turned out well!",
