Instead I made 4 small (5 inch diameter)round loaves I used for bread bowls with a soup, and used the remainder to make a large loaf which I braided to give it more pizazz.  The texture and the taste are very nice, just a hint of sweetness, which added to the soup I'd made.  Good stuff, I save it for future use.",
