I only had white cake mix so I used that and added a good amount of each ground cinnamon and nutmeg along with a few sprinkles of ground ginger to the mix and on top of the rhubarb. I'm also not a fan of sweet desserts so I used just a half cup of sugar on top. For me and my family, it turned out perfect! Oh, and my rhubarb was frozen so I made sure to lay it out on paper towels AND squeezed excess water out of it before spreading it on the cake. Not doing so will most likely give you soup. Thanks, Michelle, for this one, I'll be using it a lot!",
