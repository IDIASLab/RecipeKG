I would have liked a little more cheesecake flavor, but I did use reduced-fat cream cheese, that was the only deviation from the recipe.  The strawberry flavor comes through well, and that flavor is the more prominent.  As I always do with pies of this type, I put it in the freezer to make slicing easier.  All it takes is several minutes at room temp, and you're ready to plate. There was more filling than the pie shell would hold, so I poured it into a couple dessert cups for a pudding parfait.  Next time, I'll try fat-free evaporated milk and sugar-free Jell-O to lower the calories, but this is an easy dessert with good eye appeal.",

The evaporated milk in this caught my eye.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using raspberry gelatin instead of strawberry.  I didn't have any problem with it setting up, but the texture was kind of odd, fizzy and fluffy.  The taste was just ok.  Those who had trouble whipping the evaporated milk, it must be COLD.  I popped the can in the freezer for about 20 minutes and it whipped - not quickly, but it did thicken. The gelatin will thicken in 20 minutes if you put it in the freezer instead of the refrigerator. However, there is no way you can \"fold\" the cream cheese mixture which has the texture of soft cookie dough, with the jello/milk mixture.  I ended up gently stirring them together.  This recipe gets way too many dishes dirty for the end result. Not worth making again.",

I used a regualr white cream cheese and whipping cream instead of evaporated milk which made it heavier so I think the evaporated milk would do more justice. However it was too sweet for me: I like the tangy type of cheesecake. Next time I would surely use this recipe again but tweak it with less sugar. I am sure the strawberry gelatin could easily be exchanged for lemon pine-apple or peach to your liking.",

I omitted the evaporated milk bc I didn't have any --  and blended the softened cream cheese  into the warm strawberry gelatin, so yes I made changes to mirror the recipe I had - but no issues with fitting into a store bought graham crust  - was very easy & refreshing for a quick dessert with not enough calories to sneeze at!",
