Not overpowering but wanted it a little gentler. It was good but different like that. I did end up adding more sugar to make up for the extra spice. I like the premise of this recipe and I will make a version of it again. I liked the extra sweetness that I got when I added the extra sugar and did like some of the bite of the Sriracha but I should stick with 1 teaspoon next time.",

Maybe it was the type I used--so if you're going to make this recipe either know your chili paste well, or use caution with one you're not familiar with.

Pulled Pork was being served by the host and I brought the slaw. This was so tasty! I made it exactly like it said. However I used my Ninja to blend the dressing and to cut the cabbage up. The peaches were very sweet against the slaw. The spices were very mild but that worked well because the pork was spicy and the slaw kind of had a slow burn to it. It says it makes 6 servings well there were 12 people at the BBQ and I had enough for grilling out the next evening for another 4 people. Everyone commented on how much they liked it and asked for the recipe. WIN for allrecipes and a WIN for me!",

Ridiculous as it may be I had 4 different kinds of hot sauces/chili pastes in the fridge tasted each and went with the mildest. Even then I didn't use the amount specified and we're probably middle of the road on spiciness. As we all know you always can add more but you can't take it out. And this is not a criticism of the recipe because spiciness is subjective so each person should adjust to his/her own liking. This was a nice change from the same old-same old style of coleslaw.",
