This was very very good. This combines two of my favorite things cheesecake and pecan pie minus the pecans......what's not to love? I happened to have a deep dish pie crust in my freezer so that's what I used instead of homemade. The brown sugar layer was too much and would have over flowed the pie so I did pour some into a small custard cup and bake that off separately. A very pleasant surprise and something I most likely will make again.",
