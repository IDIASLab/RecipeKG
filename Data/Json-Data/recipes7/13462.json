I also wanted a make ahead meal. I modified it by leaving the quinoa and goat cheese separate from the squash/nut/chicken mixture so that we could make up our own bowl to our taste. I found this warm recipe ticked all the boxes for sweet savory crunchy soft and comfort-food-like all -in -one-one-bowl goodness. Next time I'll add a green veggie on the side or a salad. Looking forward to trying it as a cold salad with balsamic as suggested.",
