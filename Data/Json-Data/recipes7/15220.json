However, I only zested half an orange because I had used the other half for biscotti, and I think the full orange (as the recipe called for) would have been perfect. I blended half - no straining needed - and spooned over some goat cheese on my Christmas charcuterie board, and left the other half chunky to serve with dinner, which was enough for 3-4 people. It set beautifully after the brief cook time. Thank you for a solid base recipe that anyone can adapt to their needs!",
