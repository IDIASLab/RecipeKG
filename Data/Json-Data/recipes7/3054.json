I used fresh ginger (1 tbsp, minced) instead of ground, sliced up a carrot, and cleaned 6 pearl onions that I had on hand. Toss everything into the slow cooker except for the peppers and rice, and set it on High for 2.5 hrs. Turn the setting down to Low, and add the cut-up peppers to the pot (I used 2 green and 2 yellow for colour).  Cook your rice separately, and once that's done, your meal is ready ! The meat was moist and tender, and I got the \"thumbs up\" from everyone.",

Also made more sauce by adding water to consomme and a little extra soy sauce (to taste). It was a big hit for my picky eaters. The meat became tender the longer I simmered it on the stovetop so be sure to leave time for it to simmer that 20 minutes or more while your rice is cooking. I may wait until a little later to add my peppers next time so they will be a little crispier. Will make this again - would even be a great meal for guests. Yum!",

I used 2 red bell peppers and 2 green bell peppers, but I think one could get by adding just 3 large peppers (perhaps 1-red, 1-yellow, and 1-green). I also used a low sodium soy sauce, and since I didn't have exactly 2 tablespoons of cornstarch... I used 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of flour (which worked well), I added a bit more ginger (also added an 1/8 tsp.), and instead of adding all garlic salt, I added an 1/8 teaspoon of garlic salt, and an 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder. I didn't need to sear the meat for 10 minutes, mine was cooked within 6 minutes. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes, to make this dish a bit more flavorable. I wanted to point out, after I trimmed up my 2 lbs. of round steak, I ended up with about 1 lb. plus 10-12 oz. of meat. I found this made 5 servings rather than 8. Served this one night with instant white rice, and the leftovers another night with instant brown rice. I look forward to making this dish again; as it was exceptionally good!! TUNA'S MOM, thanks for posting this recipe. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!",
