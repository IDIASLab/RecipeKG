I have some mystery berries growing in my yard that appear to be mulberries or boysenberries and used those. After I began the recipe I was worried at first it was too much sugar, but tried it as is and it wasn't too overly sweet tasting onced  it was baked. It was done in 45 minutes. It tasted good with some whipped cream and would probably be also good with a little ice cream.",

I expected there to be a nice blackberry sauce on the bottom and the cake on top, but I ended up with a thick layer of clear gelatinized sugar on the bottom because the blackberries did not sink.  They were almost all floating on top of the cake part.  I guess blackberries don't generate much juice, because there was none when I baked these that were freshly picked a few minutes before.  That said, the flavor was terrific - I added a bit of vanilla to the cake recipe.  If anyone has a suggestion for something I may have done wrong, I'd be happy to read about it.  I would like this recipe to work for me.  We have a lot of berries growing on our property and it is a simple recipe, but it's not like what MY Mom used to make!.",
