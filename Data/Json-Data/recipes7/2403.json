Because blueberries are a juicier fruit than cherries, I took the first reviewers suggestion and added 1/3 cup more of flour to the batter.  Also at the suggestion of the first reviewer, I mascerated the blueberries with 3 TBSP. of sugar, and 1/2 teason of lemon extract. (almond extract didn't seem right for blueberries.)  It turned out wonderfully and my children liked this.  The texture is not cake-like, but again, not quite custard like.  Slightly like thick crepes.  The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was for the directions given, otherwise, this was a nice change for a breakfast offering, and my family enjoyed this.",

I followed a reviewer suggestion to use almost a cup of flour. The resulting clafouti was pretty much what I expected but with a slight \"rubbery\" texture... I googled this and someone said you should not overmix it after combining the flour & liquid ingredients. You should stop handling it asap. So hope this info helps. Mine took about 55 min and a few bits stuck to bottom of pan (maybe overbaked slightly?) but we really enjoyed this! Thanks for the recipe!",

The first time I made it I used raspberries and substituted light cream for the milk I know more fat but it gets worse (see below) and 1 cup of flour and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. It was excellent! Yesterday I made it with fresh pineapple and coconut and it is delicious! The worse part (more fat) is that I made a butter sauce (both times) that I always make with bread pudding to drizzle on each individual serving. This is such a versatile recipe as it seems you can use just about any fruit or combination you like. PS This is better than the other clafouti recipe on this site that has more ratings and I made that one with blueberries!!",
