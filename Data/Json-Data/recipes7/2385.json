I loved that I could make such a big cookie and the middle actually baked through.  I have a few recommendations:  I used rice crispies and chocolate chips, use 1/3 cup scoop (made 32 cookies), put them far apart on the baking sheet because they do spread and finally...let them cool on the tray for the full 5 minutes.  As a cookie lover I was overcome by temptation and got a few off the sheet too soon and they fell apart.  Be patient and wait it out  :)  Thanks for the recipe...I will definately be making again!",

Definitely better eaten cold than warm out of the oven.  I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar.  I used skim milk instead of water and used a crispy cinnamon toast cereal.  These baked up in no time.  You can pretty much use any type of cereal and add whatever you want to make them as healthy or more cookie-like as you want depending on who you're cooking for.  ",

Here's what I do and they come out perfect every time: I use my mixer on the batter for about 20 seconds before adding the flour oats and cereal. I've used lots of different cereals like Captain Crunch Frosted Flakes and Cocoa Pebbles. If you use Cheerios you need to crush them and then the cookies don't turn out dry. I've found that using 3 cups of Rice Krispies and 3 cups of any other cereal works really well and the cookies are just right. (The higher fiber cereals need to be crushed though.) And I add 1/2 bag of milk chocolate chips and leave out the raisins. Thanks for this recipe! It's a family favorite!",
