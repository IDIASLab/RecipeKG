This is one of my very favorites, I learned to make it with my mom when I was little, this will be the first time I wrote it down! I have had it before with carrots, which I do enjoy, but I prefer it best when it is very simple. This is a very inexpensive dish.",

The pot pie comes from bot boi which is the type of PA Dutch noodles you should use for this recipe. The type of noodles you use can make or break this recipe. The large square eggs noodles are best. They don't gloop up. I've added onion and garlic seasonings to this as well as use a few beef broth cubes. As good as it tastes the first night it's even better the next day because the noodles and potatoes really absorb the juices!! Delicious!",
