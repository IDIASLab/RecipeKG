For the squash I mixed the egg with the flour before tossing with the squash. My instincts told me this would work out better though not sure if it really made a difference or not. I pan fried the steak with the veggies. That was a bad plan. I should have pan fried the steak separate and added it to the veggie mixture at the end like the recipe states. The veggies/beef gave off a ton of liquid. I drained off the liquid before adding the broth. I used 1/2 tsp worcestire and 1/4 tsp dried thyme in the broth. I still needed to use 2 T of flour to get it to thicken up. I used two casserole dishes as it looked as if it may have been too much meat/veggies for one. I used a mix of Swiss and pepper jack and probably doubled the amount called for. It was good. I especially liked the squash; I may start making squash this way from now on. The steak and sauce were good but not great. I think a few tweaks could take it to great though.",
