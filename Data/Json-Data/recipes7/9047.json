Baked at 350 they were done in just under 20 minutes. Very good cornbread recipe--very moist lightly sweet nice texture. We all really liked them.",

                "reviewBody": "I didn't have great success with this recipe, but I'm rating four stars anyway as I think some of the issues I had were mine = ) ...so consider this review just sharing my experience.  The garlic was way too strong.  I use granulated garlic, which I thought was the same as garlic powder, but maybe not; maybe this was the problem.  Also, the cheese that was exposed on top of the muffins kinda burned by the time the muffins started to brown.  Again, that could be me:  my oven.  But I really had a problem with the instructions.  The description, the blurb at the top, says 'makes 3 dozen mini', as does the serving size.  The ingredients say, for 1 T butter and 3 T cornmeal, used to prep the pans, 'divided'.  Then Step 4 says 'brush 18 mini muffin cups'.  I noticed that there were no instructions to use two pans, or bake one pan two times, but I, not being much of a baker, thot that the 1 cup flour would not yield enough to make 36, so I just prepped the pan for the 18.  I ended up making 48. Granted, mini muffin tins may vary in size, but given the inconsistencies in the instructions, I think there was a failure in editing or proofreading.  Not from the submitter, but from AR. This was kind of a mess as I like to mix the wet and dry ingredients and get them into the oven as soon as possible, because this is when the leavening starts working.  More experienced bakers probably would have known better, but not me!!",

Look beautiful and taste great. Make sure you cook long enough to get a little crunch on the bottom of the muffins. Goes great with Guy Fieri from Food Network's \"Dragon's Breath Chili\".
