The directions are a little vague, and if they are followed as written, you will not end up with tasty buns, haha. \n\nWhat I did was mix the first five ingredients together in a pyrex measuring cup, then microwave them until the liquid temperature hit about 115-120 degrees (yeast needs warmth in order to become active). Then I added the yeast, and stirred well. It took about 8 minutes for the yeast to get bubbly, and then I mixed in the salt. \n\nAfter that I poured it all into a big mixing bowl and added the flour. Then I beat it well with a wooden spoon for about two minutes until the dough started to become stretchy and less sticky. Flouring my counter well, I turned the whole mass out of the bowl and just very lightly kneaded it three or four times, then rolled the dough into a big rope. I cut it into equal pieces, rolled those into balls, and set them on a greased baking sheet to rise in my warm kitchen. \n\nThey DO INDEED RISE IN 20MINS! It was amazing, really. Next time I will actually make them a bit smaller because holy cow do they poof up! We had big huge bakery-style buns and they were awesome.",

Have a look at the yeast packet for details. Actually this recipe's directions aren't very good as far as preparing the yeast for the most success. I'd advise heating the milk, margarine, water and sugar to the recommended temperature on the yeast packet (somewhere between 115F and 130F depending on if it is regular or rapid rise)and then mix in the yeast and let it stand for 5 minutes. If it doesn't foam and bubble after 5 minutes, your yeast isn't good.",

Fast easy few ingredients no kneading what more do you want in a recipe? I put mine in the oven (turned off) with a big bowl of HOT water under the rack. Makes all of my bread raise nicely. I make big burgers with LOTS of conciments so these buns were perfect nice and dense. I halved the recipe and made 8 large buns. Warming the milk helps and to get 25 buns out of the full recipe I would think they would have to be pretty small. I liked this recipe a lot. As I said my buns raised nicely.",

I took suggestions from several others and used 2 cups whole wheat flour and the rest bread flour.  I did not have a problem with them rising, but it may have been because I let the dough rise first until doubled, and then formed the rolls and let them rise until they looked good (didn't time either rise).  I also used reconstituted dry milk instead of the stuff from the jug.  I brushed the rolls with egg and sprinkled on sesame seeds before baking--delicious!!",
