Also, make sure you use gel food coloring for the batter. The colors come out much more vibrant with gel food coloring. Side note, if you're a perfectionist the layers may not cook evenly causing the cake to be slightly lopsided. If you want to avoid that buy a cake shaver thing (it looks like a wire held tightly at both ends that you can pull your cake layer through to shave off any uneveness). Last thing, she says to use buttermilk in this recipe and I accidently bought and used cultured buttermilk- it still came out good, but I still wonder if it would've come out better if I had just bought regular buttermilk or maybe even used regular 2% milk?",

Since we have been in quarantine, we could not spend it together, so I was looking for a cake that looked really bright and colorful. Normally, I don\u2019t like a bucketload of sugar in my cakes but I was focusing on the looks this time. This recipe had 7 cups of sugar in only in the frosting. It was way too much and didn\u2019t taste good in my opinion but the looks were amazing!!!",
