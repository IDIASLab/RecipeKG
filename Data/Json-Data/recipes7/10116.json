I totally omitted white sugar leaving only 1/4 cup brown sugar and adding a cup of unsweetened peaches that I had in the freeze. It was just the right amount of sweet and VERY moist -i had sprayed my silicone cups..not necessary. next time I'll try to add 1/2 cup of oil only. Tastes healthy and delicious! made 12 muffins and two very small loaves",
