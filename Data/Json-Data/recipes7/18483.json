I had smaller apples\nSo wasn\u2019t able to get the fan effect because I would have cut all the way through the cored part. Because I was afraid I\u2019d break the apples in half- I  wasn\u2019t able to stick the raisins inside so I added them to the topping.   Instead of the apple juice I used cranberry lemonade that I had on hand.  The streusel is delicious.  With ice cream it goes over the top!   I\u2019ll make this for dessert.   It\u2019s a winner.",
