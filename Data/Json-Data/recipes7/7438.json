I varied the recipe only slightly: 1) Used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup since the fruit adds plenty of sweetness 2) Subbed out 1/2 the oil and used unsweetened applesauce instead 3) added a tiny dash of vanilla. These muffins did not have a strong banana flavor so if you're looking for that you may need to adjust the quantity of banana. I prefer it with only mild banana flavor though and thought the blueberry and lavender added such a nice fresh touch.",
