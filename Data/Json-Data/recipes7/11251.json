Other than the tiny bit of cilantro and the peppers I am not seeing the salad title.  I cooked my peppers and sauce in a different dish while cooking the shrimp as my husband didn't like the idea of  eating raw peppers with the shrimp.  We were happy with the outcome over all with this recipe, but it's a bit confusing on what is really going on here because of the title.  If you are suppose to put it over a bed of lettuce then the recipe should say so.  I will make it again using the method we did. We enjoyed the flavor very much.  I will try to buy raw shrimp next time without the shells as it's just my personal preference.",
