I was skeptical because although my kids and I like tuna I remember not really being a fan of tuna casseroles when I was younger. Anyhow it looked like a relatively quick & easy mid-week meal and I had all the ingredients on-hand so I tried it. We all really liked it....that inclues a 9-y.o. who would happily survive on PB&J & pizza for the rest of his life. He's not a fan of zucchini but said he really liked it in this dish. I halved the recipe and it made enough for the three of us to eat it two nights in a row. I love meals like this that don't have an extensive amount of ingredients and yet are still super flavorful. This is definitely a repeat!",
