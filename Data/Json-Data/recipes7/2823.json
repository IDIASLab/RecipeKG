I don't think of a martini being a sweet drink but pumpkin pie certainly is. The drink itself isn't sweet but the honey and graham crackers add that sweetness. I wasn't crazy about the first sip but found that I liked this well enough as long as I had a little of the honey and graham cracker with each sip. I finished it quickly - maybe too quickly.;)",
