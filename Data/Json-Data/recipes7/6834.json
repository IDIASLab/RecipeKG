Buckwheat flour is very nutritious: it contains the 8 amino acids, is high in lysine, and is a good source of B vitamins and iron - and it's gluten-free!",

I try to fend them off with any recipe I can find and of course zucchini bread is constantly being baked. So it s nice to find a recipe that offers something a little different. The buckwheat flour adds a subtle change to the ordinary zucchini bread. The bread is not as moist as most zucchini breads I ve made but it has good flavor.",
