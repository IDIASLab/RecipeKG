I only had 4 cups of berries so I made the 4 dishes and skipped the berry sauce. The bake time was right on with my oven. I thought the cinnamon was a little overbearing but DH did not. Since I m the baker next time (and there will be a next time) I will cut the amount in half. I served them warm with a scoop of frozen vanilla yogurt. Not being a very good baked fruit pie maker I must have cut my slits too wide because you can tell by the picture a lot of juice seeped out. I ll do better next time. The final look of the dessert certainly did not take away from the taste. My package of frozen berries consisted of: Unsweetened strawberries blackberries blueberries and red raspberries. Good selection this week.",
