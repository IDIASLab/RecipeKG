Only had 3/4 C of sugar on hand and it was MORE than enough when combined with the sweetened coconut. Any more would render it waaaay too sweet. Also added vanilla because well vanilla. About halfway through cooking-- foiled covered the pie crust and sprinkled some more coconut on top for a little toasted flavor. Did I mention how easy it was to make?",
