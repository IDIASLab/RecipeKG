Almonds were what I found first in the freezer so I used a handful of those. The almond flavoring was a little strong for me and not enough amaretto. I will probably swap the extract for it the next time and try it with the pecans and use a cake pan. My glass pie plate took a lot longer it finally dawned on me I had to lower the temperature for it. Great recipe Sueb! My son finally got around to trying a piece I saved for him he said that was some good stuff! (High praise from him he's not much of a sweet eater and he is a chef)",

I was worried that I'd screwed it up a bit as it took quite awhile longer to cook the cake through and then when I flipped it over the top seemed really wet and soggy. After cooling and sitting out for the afternoon though it firmed up more and while it was a little gooey (not sure if that's how it was supposed to be) but definitely really tasty. I made it in a springform pan as I didn't trust my ability to turn it out of a pie plate in one piece and I think my pie plate would have been too small anyway. I guess I should have played with the oven temp to cook it properly due to my pan change but it still came out great and everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe sueb",
