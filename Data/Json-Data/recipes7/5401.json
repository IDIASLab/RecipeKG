Perked up plain carrots.\" I followed Froghopper's recipe exactly and was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked these b/c I'm a carrot-purist (either crunch'n raw or steamed w/ a little EVOO s&p.) With the glaze they're a little slimy but the taste is sweet and unusual w/ that ample addition of ginger. Oh and as a little watch-yourself warning during the last boil/stir step my hands took a couple unexpected small burns as the glaze kept hopping around the pot much like a frog would:)",
