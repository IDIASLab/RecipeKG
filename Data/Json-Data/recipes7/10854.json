It does look like it's not going to work until the last cube or 2 of butter but it does. Only thing is you need to use non-water based food coloring to color it because of the high fat content. Tastes the best everyone raves about it!",

It is somewhat time consuming, but so simple to make ... once the egg white/sugar mixture is dissolved, the rest of the hard work is done by your mixer.  For each step in the mixer,  just turn it on and walk away .... the longer it mixed, the better.  I halved the recipe and still had a large amount leftover after icing 24 cupcakes.  I did make it the day before and put it in the refrigerator overnight. One note- if you make it ahead, you might want to let it sit out to come back to room temp before mixing again.  I was in a rush to frost the cupcakes and sat the mixer bowl in a bowl of warm water for a few mins and that worked fine too.  Can't wait to try again!!",

I halved the recipe and added 1 13 oz. can of dulce de leche at the very end for a delicious caramel flavor. I had just enough to frost and fill a 3-layer cake made with 9 inch rounds. I made the frosting a couple days before I assembled the cake so I covered it in saran wrap and refrigerated it-- I had to mix on medium speed for about 5 minutes to get the right consistency again. If you have any problems with the frosting being soupy or looking curdled just keep mixing and maybe add a couple more tbsp of colder butter.",

I used this recipe as well as a few tips from around the internet and I couldn\u2019t be happier. I agree with the previous reviewers that it takes a lot of time, but not a lot of active time. Set your stand mixer and walk away (I wouldn\u2019t have attempted this without AT LEAST an electric mixer) read a book, watch a movie, overall quite relaxing. \n\nMy egg/sugar mixture came up to temperature in about 5 minutes, rather than 10 that the recipe indicated and was about 160 degrees when I checked it (I also did checked it with my fingers since I doubted my thermometer after only 5 minutes). I followed other instructions and took my butter out of the fridge and cut it up right when I put the sugar/egg mixture on to mix. By the time I was ready to add the butter it was soft enough to stab with a fork, but nowhere near as soft as I would want for a cake batter or cookies, regardless, my meringue didn\u2019t break as I added the butter. I added butter very slowly (didn\u2019t add another cube until the first cube was no longer visible). \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to make this buttercream the same day I\u2019m making a cake, but I like to make my cakes the day before, add a crumb coat, and refrigerate overnight. (I made an american buttercream for the crumb coat since I didn\u2019t feel like making this recipe last night). \n\nThis buttercream was exactly what I needed for the textured cake the ",
