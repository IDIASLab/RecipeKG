I had to pour off some of the water as it was too much. I didn't use the white sugar based on some reviews that said it was too sweet. When the beans were done with the brown sugar and salt I found it a little bland for my taste (could have been the missing butter) so I threw in a little more salt and about a tablespoon of garlic and sauteed it all for a couple more minutes. Then they were amazing! I will definitely be making it again with my revisions.",
