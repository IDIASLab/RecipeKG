I've tried it in cakes, pies, cobblers, crisps, etc. This recipe was rhubarb's last stand. If I didn't like this I was giving up on rhubarb for good. And oh, boy! It is amazing. I can't wait for my rhubarb patch to ripen up this spring so I can make it again.",

Take the milk and butter and cook it on the stove as directed, let it cool while preparing the other items on the list, them pour the milk mixture in the rhubarb mixture, then pour all on top of the bread( left the crust on) let sit a little to soak in. I mixed up some of the rhubarb to go into the bread. Wow is this good, will make this all summer.",
