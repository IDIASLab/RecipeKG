Used  a fresh lime (2 tbsp juice/lime) and didn't have canola oil so I used vegetable oil. It's amazing. I made honey and lime zest glaze for chicken to go in the salad with it, and since the salad had berries added 1 blackberry and 4 blueberries after I had already tried the initial flavor. Either way is DELICIOUS.",

I was looking for a fresh dressing to go with my avocado mango salad, and found this to be perfect, especially since I had a bunch of limes on the table. I am always a fan of fresh ingredients, so I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. I also substituted out the white sugar, so I ended up using about 2 1/2 T honey. I will definitely use this recipe again... especially since my friends have taken most of the leftovers. :)",
