I found that slicing in X in the bottom of the cherry then gently squeezing out the seed to be the easiest and quickest method. You may want to wear gloves because the juice will stain your cuticles. I did half with vanilla extract and half with cherry extract to bring out the cherry flavor. Just go easy on the cherry extract...too much will give it a cough syrup flavor.",

Yes you do have to spit out the pit this way but it wasn't a big deal for us.",

The problem is that the pit is connected to the stem so it makes it hard to keep the stem in place. I mixed the vanilla and sugar and used the microwave set at the lowest temperature to get it hard. That worked well. I place the hard sugar lumps into the cherries and dipped them in the chocolate. The chocolate seized so I thinned it with some Crisco shortening and that worked well. The problem then was that you couldn't dip the cherry without the stem coming off as it is not connected to the pit anymore. I tasted them and they were too sweet for me. I'm sorry Barry I would love to give this a higher rating but I feel it's important to give my honest review.",
