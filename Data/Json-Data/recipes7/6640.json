I have the fondest memories of my grandmother and my mother making this when strawberries came into season. The cake itself is not very sweet, although the icing is. The balance is perfect. I make this for many occasions, and my secret taste testers have remarked how wonderful it is. Just a side note: using fresh, sweet strawberries is the key.",

                "reviewBody": "I had fun playing with this, seeing if I could improve upon some issues of concern.  First, I thought it unusual that baking soda was in the ingredients list, but not baking powder, especially since there wasn\u2019t anything particularly acidic in the ingredients like lemon juice or buttermilk that would necessitate that.  I also noticed the flour to sugar ratio was off, with not enough sugar.  The submitter herself states the cake is not very sweet.  And, while there aren\u2019t many reviews of Aunt Kate\u2019s cake, even some mentioned it was heavy and dense.  Since the submitter also mentioned the cake was from the early 1900\u2019s, I thought maybe baking powder wasn\u2019t on the market yet.  Nope, it was introduced in the mid 1800s.  Still, I thought some baking powder was needed to give the cake some lift, making it lighter and fluffier.  Knowing baking soda is four times as powerful as baking powder, I used  1/4 tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. of baking powder and just 1/4 tsp. salt.  One cup of strawberries seemed a lot to me for this little cake, which I thought might be \u201cdragging\u201d the cake down \u2013 I reduced it from 1 c. to 3/4 c. and added 1/2 tsp. of natural strawberry extract to compensate. Finally, I wanted the cake a little sweeter so I added 2 T. more sugar. I baked this as cupcakes and the changes did prove to result in a light and fluffy, nicely sweet cake. This is just slightly strawberry flavored, but once covered with the frosting (I added 1/2 tsp. strawberry extract) it was just right.",

This cake has great flavor the strawberry flavor was perfect. It was actually really good. I did sub butter for the shortening. My only complaint is that it was a little dense and just a tad bit dry. Will definitely be making this again. I love that you use real strawberries and the cake is made from scratch. Thanks for the recipe!",

Here is what I changed: 1) I used 1 1/2 cup sugar instead of just 1 cup. 2) Since I modified the sugar amount, I had to use a little extra shortening. (about 1/4 cup extra). 3) I ran my strawberries through the food processor. That really did the trick. You can save some of your strawberries to slice and place on the top of the frosted cake. 4) I used about 3/4 teaspoon baking soda instead of a half teaspoon.  5) There was too much flour. I used about 1 1/2 cup altogether. 6) This fit nicely in a 9x13 pan. 7) This cake is VERY heavy and moist, but that's how we like it. 8) FOR THE FROSTING: I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and replaced the butter with shortening. With these modifications (yes, there is a lot of them) this cake was a hit, and just what I was looking for. Don't succumb to using a cake mix!!!",

                "reviewBody": "\"Grease a cake pan.\" What size cake pan? Judging from the amount of flour, I surmised an 8\"-9\" round pan, or an 8\"X8\" square. I backed the soda off to 1/4 tsp and added a tsp of baking powder, since the consensus appeared to be that the cake as written was dense and muffin-like. Also added a bit more sugar (3 Tb,) since many have stated the cake is not sweet enough. 25 minutes was about perfect. I added half of a block of cream cheese to the frosting, and it was delicious. The cake itself doesn't have a lot of strawberry flavor, but when the strawberries are pureed and added to the frosting, that revs up the flavor significantly. Pureeing gave the frosting a consistent, non-chunky pinkness. All in all, as written, the recipe has flaws, hence the 3 stars. But, happily, it was salvageable after the changes delineated above. With those modifications, it's pretty good, 4-1/2 stars.",
