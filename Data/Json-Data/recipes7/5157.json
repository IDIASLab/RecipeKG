I found as I was going to describe this, as \"light and fresh,\" that the submitter had already described it perfectly himself.  This was exactly what I had in mind when I was searching for a tomato-cucumber salad this morning and I found this one particularly appealing in that it called for three different acids - the balsamic vinegar, the lighter red wine vinegar and lemon juice. Loved it, especially with the lemon juice and zest, as I don't generally like the heavy, sweet taste of balsamic vinegar.  Classic, Mediterranean ingredients and flavors, easily mixed in proportions to suit your own tastes - in my case that would mean a little more olive oil and no sugar.  I seeded the tomatoes before chopping so as not to have their excess liquid in the salad.  The salad, now hours after I put it together, is already even better since the flavors have had a chance to marry.  Since fresh basil has a tendency to turn black, I will add that just before serving.  Any leftovers (if there are any!) I plan to mix with some ceci beans (garbanzo beans) for a healthy, light lunch.  Beautiful salad, full of flavor and pleasantly so!",
