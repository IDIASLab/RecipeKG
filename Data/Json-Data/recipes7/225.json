The batter should be almost liquid so its easier to pour it on the pan.  If it goes too thick, just add more milk/water.  The bliny should be thin, as thin as you can make them.\n\nWe used to make huge piles of bliny, just buttering and stacking them (often we used 2 frying pans at a time to speed the process - just got to find your rythm :D).  Then you pick them one by one, put the jem on (I use freshly blended cranberries + sugar), fold them (we dont roll them like creppes, rather just fold in half, then quarter, then 8th) and eat them while they are hot, with hot black tea with lemon. Thats the way.\nps. There are many recepies for Bliny. Buckweet, oatmeal, with or without yeast - you name it, you can make bliny with them, but the recepies would differ greatly for these varieties.  This one better used as it is.  ",

Unfortunately there's a ton of those kinds of reviews on this site and it's a shame that anyone would be turned off by great recipes reviewed in such ways.\n\nThat said, this batter should be thin. Freakishly thin. So much that you worry it's not a batter at all. But trust in the ingredients and it will turn out correctly. Mine almost never come out round, so don't worry if yours don't either.\n\nKeep the heat fairly low, I use the click just to the left of Medium on my stove. But also keep in mind that because of the amount of liquid, these are really hard to burn. Which is good because they need the cooking time in order to stay together.\n\nIf you feel the need to add some yeast for the sake of staunch traditionalism, go for it. I didn't notice anything to write home about. This is a good recipe for anyone who doesn't want to waste a whole package of yeast just for some pancakes.\n\nIf you feel it needs to be made with buckwheat (though there's nothing in the overall definition of the blini/blintz family that says it has to be made that way), well there is a recipe on here for the buckwheat version.\n\nLastly, I've also made this recipe with water instead of milk and it worked really well, just decrease the amount of liquid by about a half-cup for the full recipe.",

Another thing you can do to them is take cream cheese (whole package) sour cream (about half of a normal size) maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup of sugar and cottage cheese. Mix well. Add a spoon or 2 to each of your \"blini\" roll each one up place in a glass pan (all) and bake for about 20-30 minutes at 325. Check to see if they're done; if cottage cheese is gone then they're done!! Good luck and priyatnovo appetita (bon appetite)!!!!!",
