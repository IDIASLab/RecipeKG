I couldn't handle it without covering my hands in flour often. In the breadmaker, the dough rose so high it was about to pop the top off. -- After cutting the dough into 12 balls and letting it rise again, I had the unfortunate task of figuring out how to deal with softball-size balls of dough. Once risen, they completely filled the 9x13 pan. I tipped the dough out of the pan and rolled them back into 12 balls. Putting six each on two flat cookie sheets, I baked them like that. Out of the oven, I let them cool for a couple of minutes before drizzling the frosting on top. It was all I could do to keep from eating one right then!-- The result was a tenderly sweet bun that wasn't overly spiced but just enough to make them smell delicious. ",

I made an egg wash with 1 egg yolk and 1 tbsp of cream and brushed the buns just before placing in the oven.  I didn't have cardamom so I used nutmeg and cinnamon.  Also I would suggest making half of the icing for the crosses cause it was way too much.  I also made a syrup of 2 tbsp sugar and 1/3 cup water and a tsp of vanilla extract to brush on the buns as soon as I took them out of the oven.  Also, 12 buns couldn't fit in a 13x9 pan, so I placed 8 buns in the pan and the other 4 in a 8 inch cake dish.  These buns are soft and delicious and very yummy..it is a great recipe!!  My husband has had quite a few and I ate 2 as soon as it came out of the oven. This recipe is definitely a keeper.",

I also cut down on the glaze. Some mentioned that it makes more than necessary. I halved it and still had lots left over. I could also see that I was going to get 12 monster rolls, so I formed 16 and baked the extra in an 8x8 pan. They were a perfect size. My add-ins were currants and dried cherries.
