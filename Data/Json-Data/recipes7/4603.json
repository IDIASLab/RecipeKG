                "reviewBody": "This cake was very good. It actually may have been too gooey from the apples inside which is why next time I make this cake I will definitely use 2-3 apples and 1.5 times the batter. I didn't want to stick such big chunks of apples in the middle of my cake so I sliced them about 1/4 inch thick. Instead of sprinkling all of the cinn. sugar on top of them I laid down a layer and then sprinkled some and then laid down another layer of apples and then more cinn. sugar on top of that (dividing the 1/2 cup of the mixture btwn the 2 layers). I will also use less than what remained of the mixture on top of my cake as I felt it was too much and didn't brown but rather came out of the oven as a pile of dry sand on top of my cake (although you can easily wipe some off). I also made this the day before my sedar and I cut it into squares while warm as directed but very much regret doing so. It looks crumbly and not nice and I would rather have re-warmed it right before serving and put it on the table as whole cake for presentation purposes (and then cut it into squares). Since I did already cut it into squares I will put the pieces in pretty cupcake holders and serve them on a tray to make them look nicer. All in all great flavor but I recommend less apples more batter and thinner sliced apples layered with the cinn. sugar mixture...This recipe is a keeper!",

Increased the recipe servings to 15 to get an even number of eggs and then instead of all that vegetable oil, used apple sauce. Probably used maybe quarter cup oil and the rest just apple sauce. Came out super moist! Divided into two cake pans and baked for 35 minutes since it was thick. Then once cooled, put apple butter between the layers. Dusted confectioners sugar on top. Something to keep in mind: while most cake batter is rather liquid, this one was very thick. At first it made me concerned but I just added a bit more orange juice and left it on the thicker side. Overall, great Passover cake! Definitely a winner!!",
