I had never made these before, but I was craving pumpkin and decided to try a few things out. I filled a whole pan of 12 cakes, 11 of which I sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. One of them I left plain. They tasted a bit weird warm, but once cool and with some more of the cinnamon and sugar, 11 Bundt cakes were heavenly. The plain one was, well... plain. In another pan of 12, I tried a few with chocolate chips. They were good, but I HIGHLY recommend lots of cinnamon and sugar instead.  Our company loved them, and they were demolished in a few days. I will definitely make these again.",

I added some ganache on the top to help with the flavor profile and because it looks pretty. I also felt the texture was more muffin like (dense) vs cake like, but that may be my fault for working the batter too much.",
