That way when you are making several waffles you will not burn the sugar from previous waffles.",

This is the third Liege waffle recipe I have tried- the first of which was excellent, but required you to start making them a day ahead.  The second were too bland and bready.  This recipe comes very close to flavor and texture of the 24 hour recipe, but in about 2 hours from start to finish.  I, too, was concerned about the amount of butter, but decided to try the recipe as indicated anyway.  I had no problems with too much butter, and I think it even contributes to the richness of the waffle.  Perhaps the reviewer that had the butter leaking issues let their dough rise in a place that was too warm, causing the dough to \"weep\" butter.  Overall, this recipe is definitely a keeper!",

Drizzle a couple teaspoons of boiling water over it and mix in until sugar is clumpy.  Throw in a hot oven for 3 or 4 minutes until it gets sizzly and then toss around with the parchment paper to break into small clumps. I paid about 12 bucks for the larsens sugar and was really dissapointed. We got these at Bruxies for $4 each, but my homemade with raw sugar are much better!",
