The only change I made was substituting spinach leaves for bok choy since I didn't have any on hand - I just added the spinach leaves to the wok just before serving so they would wilt from the heat. I didn't add any extra salt since it was already pretty salty from the fish sauce and oyster sauce. We served it over steamed rice. My husband really really liked it. Good recipe and nice to use up any extra broccoli and cauliflower you might have on hand.",
