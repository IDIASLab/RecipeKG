One change I would suggest is stirring together the chicken stock, sugar, vinegar and anchovy paste, before adding to the skillet, so there would be a more even distribution.  When the cauliflower was tender-crisp, I used a slotted spoon to remove it from the skillet to a bowl.  Then, I let the liquid reduce to about one-third, and poured it over the dish.  Dee-lish!  Thanks for a way to \"dress up\" cauliflower that doesn't involve cheese or bread crumbs!",
