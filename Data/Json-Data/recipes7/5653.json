This was the easiest most incredibly delicious and well received breakfast I've served in quite some time. Not to sweet at all just the perfect amount. I used a 1 1/2 lb loaf of sourdough bread cut to large cubes with 9 ex-large eggs. I upped the milk to closer to 2 cups and increased the almond extract to a teaspoon. I also used a jar of my home canned pears instead of store bought. I didn't slice them but instead left them in halves. Once baked (65 minutes in my oven) it puffed up beautifully. Also topped the servings with fresh whipped cream flavored with almond extract and almond slices. Totally yummy and will most certainly make again. Love it and thanks for submitting this recipe.",

Next time I will increase the pears so there is a solid layer of them; as is they are too far between and you're only likely to get one every other bite. I went ahead and put on the almonds before baking. It was easier and didn't have any adverse effect. The sourdough and almond extract make this a special french toast. A definite keeper",

I halved the recipe and made it in a glass pie dish using 6 slices of whole wheat sourdough bread and egg beaters (by the way 1 cup is equal to about 4 large eggs). I did not use almonds. I forgot to layer the brown sugar on the bottom but remembered before I placed it in the fridge so I layered it on the top. Then when it was done I flipped it and sprinkled it with more brown sugar and placed it back in the oven for 5 minutes to get all melty. As you can see from my picture it did stick a bit because the sugar caramelized on top. If I were to get the sugar in the right order I'm sure it would be lovely to serve to guests!",

Everyone loved it. 2 1/2 cups of eggs is (according to my own recipe) about 8-12-depending on if you're using medium or large eggs.
