Still delish still light and wholesome but admittedly a bit gritty at the end...we were ok with that and ate 'em happily. The butter content is what makes these amazing. I used unsweetened coconut shredded real small I think chunkier would have been more interesting and it could have stood the mini amount of sugar that comes with sweetened coconut. I will make these again they are unique and satisfying.",
