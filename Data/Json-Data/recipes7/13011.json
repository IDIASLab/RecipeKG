Followed the rest of the recipe exactly, but increased the baking time to about 10-20 minutes depending on the cookie thickness and size. \n\nAfter it comes out of the oven, leave it to cool for one minute. If you can shift it around the baking sheet without it crumbling, it's good to go. Otherwise, I popped it back into the oven. Once it can be moved, I let it cool on a wire rack. \n\nCookies spread out a little, so the 2\" gauge was pretty good. Texture is crunchy on the outside, a little soft on the inside (perhaps shortening the baking time might make it more chewy). \n\nSo yummy and easy to make!",
