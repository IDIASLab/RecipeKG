I had only a small (approx 8 oz) can of creamed corn, so I added about 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup more of buttermilk to make up for it.  I was concerned about the consistency of the batter--it was about as thick as cooked cream of wheat--but the muffins rose up nicely and are not dense.  Given others' complaints about saltiness, since I was using salted butter I reduced the added salt to a dash, but it could actually use a little more.  Perhaps 1/2 tsp if using salted butter is the happy medium.  I put in half a 4.75 oz can of green chilis to give it zing, and topped each one with a bit of shredded cheddar cheese to get a crackly, flavorful top.  This made exactly four dozen mini muffins.  Though they came out of the metal mini-muffin tins crispier, even those baked in the silicone mini-muffin pan have a satisfying texture, chewy on the outside and velvety on the inside.",

ADD: I have tried adding 1/2 cup sugar but it doesn't make a difference in taste. If you want to sweeten it perhaps try 1 cup of sugar. Or eat it like my grandmother does - with butter and maple syrup on top. Also my oven won't go to 450 degrees without setting off the smoke detectors so for me 20 minutes at 400 degrees is just right.",
