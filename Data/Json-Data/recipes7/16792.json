                "reviewBody": "I really liked the flavor of these biscotti; they're pumpkin-y and spicy and great with a cup of coffee! I did have issues with the bake times, however. At the first bake, I needed 38 minutes to get the biscotti baked through--had I removed them at the 20-24 minute mark, they'd of been vastly underbaked (i.e. totally wet still), and impossible to cut. On the second bake, I lowered the oven temp to 300 and baked one side for 20 minutes, flipped the cookies, then baked for another 25. I think reducing the oven temp even further is unnecessary, and would take more time than needed. With my adjustments to baking times/temps, I got perfectly crispy biscotti with a great crunch. I would make these again. Thanks for the recipe!",
