This was ok and good at the soft-serve consistency and had a very strong yogurt flavor (which is ok, it is yogurt) but this is nothing more than a block of hard frozen solid yogurt when allowed to ripen in the freezer (I did overnight) leaving me to wonder why I went through the process of using an ice cream maker.  I know to leave it sit out for a bit to soften but you get the same results if you place a container of yogurt in the freezer stiring it a few times before it freezes to a solid and serving before that frozen solid state.",
