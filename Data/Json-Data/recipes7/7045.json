A couple suggestions: only use 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon as it is a very potent spice and 2 whole teaspoons makes the crust extremely sweet. You can also use natural unsweetened strawberries either frozen or fresh and the cheesecake tastes just as good!",

I also made sure to use my ingredients at (almost) room temperature and after pouring it in the spring-pan I let it rest for about 5 minutes to let the bubbles rise.  I baked it for 65 minutes then left it in the oven (off) for another hour then put it (uncovered and still in the pan) in the fridge until the next evening.  The crust was crisp and delicious & a great contrast to the creamy cheesecake. Everyone loved the strawberry sauce in the middle and the extra swirled on top!",
