So I made it with the white vinigar , just fried the meatballs and let them simmer in the sauce just like my moms and it tasted so close just minus the love. I will make again and again with my changes. I usually just eat the meatballs and sauce by them selves,  or on top of rice or on top of mashed potatoes. I find it to be more of a bbq sauce type sauce . I have made them 3 times now and am about to make them again tonight but I am doubling the sauce  cause hubby doesn't like the meatballs simmered in the sauce but he still likes to put a little sauce on top of his meatballs and rice.
