Don't try to substitute dried ginger because it just doesn't give you that bright hit of fresh ginger flavor. And when you do the cornstarch thickener make sure your water is cold when you mix it in. Thanks for a good recipe Bob!",

Unfortunately you may still find it high because of the nature of the beast (soy sauce) so to speak. Kikkoman is my favorite brand I admit (it's what I grew up on) and I really like the lower sodium version as it retains the original flavor. I can't speak for any other brand. You can certainly try and find others that are lower. Good luck and hope this helps...with Kikkoman it has a green bottle cap.",
