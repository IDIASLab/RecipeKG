They are PLENTY sweet with that amount!  I also add a t. of vanilla extract to the wet mix!  YUM!!!!!  I've never tried walnuts but I am right now...they are currently baking.

The first time I did this, I didn't lower the salt amount, and it tasted like a salty-sweet snack. They were delicious! This time, I'm lowering it to maybe half a teaspoon for a sweeter taste. You can't go wrong with this recipe!\n\nUPDATE: I lowered the salt to 1/4 tsp as recommended by some users, and I definitely recommend it.",

But if you want to kick it up a couple of notches, here are a few suggestions:\n- As mentioned before, replace the water with vanilla.\n- Add 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the sugar/cinnamon mixture. The unexpected heat makes people go crazy for them! \n- After you mix the nuts in with the egg mixture, remove them from it using a slotted spoon and then toss them into the sugar mixture. All of the excess egg is not necessary. \nBTW, this recipe works with mixed nuts, as well, but pecans are best. Enjoy!",

Try it once as is, if you feel they're not insanely perfect, then I guess start making additions, subtractions or substitutions.  I certainly won't .  They're a perfect 10 and would make a very welcome gift for special occasions or the holidays.  Helpful hint:  to coat with sugar mixture, place sugar in a large plastic bag, add egg wash coated pecans and shake the bag to coat them.  Each piece will come out evenly coated.",

I read all the reviews first to see what people did different, and I did them all plus my own twist.\nFirst I reduced the sugar to only 1/2 cup, and added honey! Replaced the water with vanilla, same amount of cinnamon, a dash of water,NO SALT but what I did different is instead of mixing the sugar mix separate i just added it in when the pecans were coated with the egg mix.  Then to give it a good twist for the adults I added a cap full of whiskey and vodka. \nSuch a great snack for everyone, naturally for children leave out the alcohol but still a great snack. Believe me by adding the alcohol gives it a different sweet taste, can't wait to do this again!",
