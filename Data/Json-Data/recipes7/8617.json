I didn't soak overnight, just threw it all in there lol I adjusted the servings to 2, for just myself, and it took about 2 hours to cook.  It came out WONDERFUL! I used Texas Toast, and I don't have any flour so I used some Buttermilk Pancake Mix instead, which flour is it's mainly ingredient. Also didn't cube the bread, but instead made a \" Sandwich\" using sweetened. cream cheese. MMmm...this will be a weekend favorite for me from now on! :-)",
