I assume that is due to the wording \"1 cup sweetened whipped cream\". I believe this should read \"1 cup whipping cream\" which is then to be added to the slightly browned butter-sugar mixture and THEN boiled. Evaporated milk may be substituted for the cream which lends a very delicious flavor....and this coming from a cream-lover! Without a liquid the butter-sugar mass will simply scorch.",

I will make this again but the next time I will definitely add more fruit and omit the nutmeg in favour of either more cinnamon or perhaps some mixed spice as I'm not a big fan of nutmeg and I found it a bit dominant in this recipe. In addition the cranberries although I had floured them all migrated to the top of the basin whilst cooking which resulted in a rather uneven distribution of fruit throughout the pudd. As for the sauce I incorporated a 1/2 cup of double cream right into the sugar mixture before carefully reducing it to the consistency of a hard sauce. The thick exceedingly rich butterscotch of the sauce complimented the pudding perfectly.",

Using a pudding mold instead of a casserole will probably solve this problem. Will place a rack in bottom of stock pot next time.",
