My husband said a shot of tequila would improve it greatly:-)",

It is wonderful that way too. I used raw sugar and honey in place of the sugar and added some ice cubes in place of some of the water. Also it worked better for me to start with the water mix in the sugar and lime and then gradually add a chunk of zucchini at a time blending as I went. Then after the zucchini was all blended I added in the ice cubes. I'll be making this often. I peeled it today but next time I might try with the peelings on.",
