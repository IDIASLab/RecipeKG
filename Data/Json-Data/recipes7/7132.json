Instead of making the marinade as stated I tossed the zest of 1 lime (not sure how much it yielded) mint shallot salt and sugar together in a bowl and let it marinade a few minutes. I pan fried the shrimp on the stove then when it was done added in the lime juice and rum. It was phenomenal! Served it over white rice and the sauce was delicious. A new family favorite!",
