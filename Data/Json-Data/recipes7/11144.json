This is actually the 2nd time I have made it and while the basic recipe is great I did add a few things to mine: I increased the ginger from half to a full teaspoon I increased the vanilla likewise. I also layered the batter with about a half a cup of white chocolate chips. Batter on the bottom 1/4 cup of chips repeat. I also made a ginger cinnamon simple syrup and as soon as it leaves the oven I poke the top several times and pour the syrup over. When cooled it really increases flavor and moistness.",
