I added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and thought it was a nice addition. I did, though, feel as though the muffins were a little sweet. In the future (on a double recipe) I will try cutting the sugar back by 1/4 cup. All in all, a great recipe that my whole family enjoyed!!",

The BEST thing is that this recipe can be easily adapted for diabetics by using whole wheat flour and Stevia (2 tbl. plus 2 tsp. Stevia in place of 1/2 cup sugar) and it still tastes great!  Thank you for an excellent recipe!!! :)))",

Both were delicious.",

Since these are going to be used for school snacks I made one healthy adaption and that was to substitute whole wheat flour for the 3/4 cup all-purpose flour. I also tossed in grated carrot for a little more color and nutrition. My little one didn't even notice! So he's getting a delicious healthy snack made from scratch; I froze the whole batch and take out two at time to send with my child to school. Last note: I quadrupled the recipe so indeed I used a total of 3 cups of whole wheat flour no problems. (I've heard one part whole wheat to three parts all-purpose...?) And like I said I tossed in about one cup of shredded carrots. Also I added two more eggs for a total of 6 eggs for the 4x recipe. All in all THIS recipe is THE recipe I will be using for zucchini muffins. Simply delicious:) Thank you for sharing.",
