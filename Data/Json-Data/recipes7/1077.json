I browned the meat in a skillet then sauteed the onion and garlic and placed all of the ingredients in a crock pot but I cut the amount of water down to 3 cups.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and added the dumpling mix and cooked it an additional 20 min until dumplings were done.  I doubled the dumpling recipe but found that it was the consistency of pancake batter so I would reduce the amount of milk next time.  Perhaps just add milk until it reached the desired consistency.  The flavor was absolutely fantastic.",

I compared this to my mother's stew recipe (using 1 lb. more meat) and it only uses 3 c. liquid.  1/2 c. milk for the dumplings makes a thin batter like another reviewer said and mine just disintegrated in the stew and made a medium thick gravy with all that fluid.  I would also cut back on the thyme since marjoram is similar.\n\nI will say I liked the taste and will try it again using 3 cups of water or broth and adding milk to the dumpling mixture a little at a time until it reached bisquick dough consistency.",
