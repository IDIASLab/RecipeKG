But I really wanted this recipe to work & after the third time, it finally did. As written, the recipe, is gritty, oily & a flop. BUT the flavor is there & that's why I took such an interest in perfecting this recipe. When making the recipe the 1st time, a huge issue, don't let the recipe start bubbling, the sugar does not break down or melt in with the chocolate and peanut butter, like you think it would. And if you let the mixture bubbly, you will get an aroma of burnt peanuts. Not a good thing. And I was on that pot like a hawk. Even the 2nd time around, same thing. The other thing is that there was soo much oil at even 1/2 cup with the amount of sugar, the oil never retain & oozed to the point that it was frying the sugar as it was baking in the pan & causing the gritty-ness that you could feel, taste and see. Both 1st two batches, glopped, couldn't be cut into squares, even completely cooled due to the excess of oil. When making the 3rd batch by cutting the oil to 1/4 cup, became a batch of brownies. It still had a slight oily residue left but no where near the 1st two batches. I can tell you, the oil might be even lowered to 2-3 TBSPs but as for modifying this recipe to make it work..lower the oil or you won't have a successful batch to enjoy. The 3rd batch was awesome! Glad I was persistant and got to enjoy a batch! As is 0 stars, as modified 5 star.",

                "reviewBody": "First of all, I did not make this recipe because it was vegan, I made it because it is a Myplate sponsored recipe. After reading the reviews, I decided to leave the oil out entirely. The recipe author said that the avocado replaced butter in this recipe, so I couldn't wrap my head around the need for any more oil if it was a replacement for oil. There is enough \"oil\" with the combination of the avocado, peanut butter and chocolate chips. Next, I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 baking dish. I used regular 1% milk in place of the soy milk (Again, not looking for this to be vegan) and doubled the amount called for. I didn't bother with \"cooking the chocolate, sugar and pb until bubbly like candy\"...I simply melted the pb with the chocolate chips in the microwave. I think cooking melted chocolate chips to this degree of heat would cause the chocolate to seize, giving you a gritty texture. I used my magic bullet to combine the milk and the avocado and then combined the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl (including the sugar, which I reduced to 1/2 cup for half this recipe). I added the melted chocolate/pb, the avocado/milk, a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and the flour mixture together and combined until just mixed. I baked them for about 20 -25 minutes in an 8x8\" pan and they came out really nice. Not greasy at all. Smooth and fudgy. With my changes, it's a 4 star, but giving it a 3 star because clearly, as written, something is not right.",

I also only used 1 cup of brown sugar and no salt (\"healthy\" brownies) and I used almond milk instead of soy. HEAVENLY. I only recently started cooking vegan, so I know what normal brownies taste like. These are comparable if not better! And less guilty! They're perfectly flavored, extremely moist but not too heavy, and delightfully fudgey. I could rave on! Mine are only 245 calories a brownie. I will definitely be making these again!!!!",

If the avocado is to replace butter then why add oil? As I originally stated I melted my peanutbutter chocolate mixture slowly in a double boiler and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. This will eliminate the graininess. 3/4 cup of sugar is probably enough. All in all I am surprised this recipe is included in the My Plate collection.",
