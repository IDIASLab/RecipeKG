With her guidance, I've made many yeast recipes, including your recipe.  The first time I made them, I forgot the salt.  Not one person noticed and every roll was gobbled up, but I knew something was a tad off.  The second time I remembered it and I noticed instantly the difference in taste.  This is a very simple recipe to follow and super easy to make with my KA mixer. They make wonderful hamburger buns and next time I'm going to try hot dog/brat buns.  Thank you for taking the time to share your grandmother's recipe.  It is a keeper!",
