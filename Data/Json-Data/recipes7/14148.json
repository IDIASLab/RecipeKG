I baked in 6 (6\"x3.5\") bread pans. I kept one and gave the other five away and got great feedback from those people. I poured two pans before adding the nuts and then added the nuts to the remaining batter for the other four loaves. I thought I might hear some resistance from my coconut hating guys. Nope not a word.......they didn't ask what the white things were and I didn't tell. Thanks for sharing your recipe Barbara.",
