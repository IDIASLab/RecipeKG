Not being a fan of instant mashed potatoes, I must say, the Idahoan Signature\u2122 Russets Mashed Potatoes are the real deal. Here's how I made mine: Dredge the fish in flour, shake off the excess and dry on a wire cooling rack for approx 15 mins. or until dry to the touch. Add only enough beer until you get the right consistency to the batter. The oil temp is important so make sure you check it with a thermometer. 365-370 degrees works best for me. A deep fryer is highly recommended.",

He followed it almost to the letter; adding a dust of flour up front and then a dip in batter, repeat on flour, double dip in batter before pan frying in a cast iron skillet. He used a mix of halibut and cod and both came out spectacular. I was concerned the Sriracha might be a little spicy, but it was not. It lifted the flavors perfectly. Served with tater tots instead of mashed potatoes, it was a really tasty meal. 5 stars well earned.",

Had to go gluten free so I used gf flour and gf beer and had to use chicken instead of fish-due to allergies but the recipe worked all the same. If you use gf flour be aware that you will probably need more beer. My batter needed a little over 1/2 cup more. Add the beer mix and wait. Then adjust as needed. It will depend on your flour blend. I also shook the chicken with some flour before putting it into the batter. I didn't have any issues of the batter sliding off. Thank you for the recipe.",
