My Grandma Sally makes these almost every year for Christmas and it is one of my favorite Christmas cookie recipes. The cookies will be chewy-crunchy when finished cooling, not gooey.",

They're not your typical dense macaroon though they're more like meringues with extra chewy crunchiness thanks to the coconut and corn flakes. Whipping one egg white in a mixmaster is next to impossible so I whipped it by hand. The recipe doesn't specify so I used sweetenend shredded coconut. The final mixture doesn't hold together very well so you just have to scoop some up with a teaspoon and stack it. The egg white will rise a bit and hold them together well. I followed the recipe exactly but used parchment paper on an ungreased cookie sheet and baked for exactly 20 minutes. Mine came out perfectly tan (lighter than lillian's photo) slightly crisp on the outside chewy on the inside. I might try with unsweetened coconut (and coconut extract) next time as they are quite sweet. Will definitely make again!",

The macaroons were crunchy and sweet. I love the addition of the cornflakes because it keeps the macaroons from being too coconutty. I only got about 20 macaroons from this recipe. I will definitely double the batch next time! Great easy recipe!",
