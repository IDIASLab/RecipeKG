I used 1 cup freshly ground white whole wheat, somewhere between 1/3 cup and 1/2 cup of cocoa,about 1.5 - 1.75 C frozen raspberries, and slightly lesss sugar & chocolate chips than called for. They don't need frosting, we're eating them as chocolate muffins. They'll be great tossed in lunchboxes. If frosted, I would go with maybe a sweetened whipped cream piped inside of them. The only downside is the raspberry seeds stuck in my teeth. Oh well! I will definitely make these again. Update: Made again, increasing the ww flour to 1/2, and replacing 1/2 C of the butter with plain greek yogurt. Also threw in a handful of old fashioned oats. They're great! I made mini muffins, cooking them 12 minutes. These will be regulars at our house.",

I think there could have been less chocolate chips...3/4 a cup would have been plenty with everything else going on. You can not taste the zuchinni at all but they are super moist. I'm sure they would be great with some frosting or whipped cream but they are really more like a muffin than a cupcake and are excellent with no topping at all!",
