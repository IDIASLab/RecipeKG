I just wanted to make a little note, depending on how fresh your plums are is what determines the amount of sugar you need. As they ripen more they tend to lose some of their sweetness, therefore needing more sugar. I live in a small part of Alaska & we tend to get fruit that is near the end of its shelf life. For fresh plums I would suggest adding only 6- 6 1/2 cups of sugar. Thanks & enjoy!",

Like candy this step is vital for it to turn out! I also upped the boxes of pectin to 2. I decreased my sugar by about a cup and added a squeeze of lemon in the mix. I also like to add 2 cinnamon sticks while it simmers for a bit of spice. The hardest work for me was de-pitting the tiny Japanese plums from our trees but my son helps. We absolutley love love love this jelly (thinner than a jam) The flavor is spicy-sweet & tart at least with my plums and added ingredients. My son tells me not to give so much away so we can have more! lol.. This is now going to be a tradition to make every summer.:)",

By adding an extra 1/2 cup of plums to recipe and cutting 1/2 cup of sugar you can increase the recipe to 12 half pint jars without losing any of the sweetness. I also used 2.35 ounces of pectin instead of the recommended 1.75 ounce. This thickened up the jam more. Also, to decrease foaming add 1 tablespoon of Lemon juice concentrate along with the butter. The Lemon Juice also helps remove air. Thank you for the inspiration DelightfulDines.",
