                "reviewBody": "I\u2019m not a food science whiz but I\u2019ve been baking a long time and I recognized some things in this recipe of concern.  So I made some changes and ended up with a darn good vanilla cupcake.  First, the baking soda - and no baking powder.  Baking soda typically is used when there\u2019s something acidic in the batter like chocolate or buttermilk but there is none here.  Also, baking soda is 4 times as powerful as baking powder so why so much?  If some reviewers complained of an off taste or if their cupcakes were crumbly and coarse too much baking soda could be the problem.  I eliminated it entirely, substituting  1-1/2 tsp. of baking powder instead.  Others reported these were dry \u2013 they might have over baked them, but I\u2019m thinking 5 T. of butter wasn\u2019t enough \u2013 I increased it to 1/2 cup.  As for technique, I didn\u2019t trust the instructions to heat the milk and butter.  I used a traditional creaming method instead \u2013 cream the butter and sugar together till light and fluffy, add the eggs one at a time, blending well after each; add the vanilla.  Add the dry ingredients, in thirds, alternately with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour.  Finally, still others mentioned a flat taste \u2013 I added 1/4 tsp. of salt rather than just a pinch, and 1-1/2 tsp. of vanilla. As I mixed up the batter I found it needed another 1/4 c. of flour.  The cupcakes rose nicely, had great flavor, and were moist with a light and tender crumb.  So, some problems as written, perfect with some tweaks.",

I also put a piece of chocolate in the middle of each cupcake right before baking because we are not very much into plain cupcakes:-) When I tasted a cupcake right from the oven it did taste a little eggy (but perhaps I was just looking for this taste...) but once the cupcakes have cooled they are perfect - moist and sort of fluffy at the same time. I think this is a perfect recipe for a basic cupcake batter and I can imagine all the variations for the creative folks - citrus flavour cocoa/chocolate coffee...",

Yes they are a little more dense so if you are looking for a light treat this is not it. But these were not only delicious they came out looking so professional! I even used tub margarine instead of butter and was not really exact with my TBSP and they still turned out amazing. Also just like what the other posters said don't be nervous about the consistency of the batter. It is suppose to be thin. These are by far the best cupcakes I have made and I think they rate right up there with some professional varieties. These are also great for bake sales because they look so pretty and are great with any icing. Yuuummmmy!",

They did look pretty and domed nicely but that is the only compliment I have for them.:( ETA: for some reason these tasted significantly better when they were 2 and 3 days old than on the first day. They still didn't compare favorably to some other cupcake recipes we have tried recently but I'm upgrading them to 3 stars now.",
