And I just pulled  the dough apart into 8 pieces (the way I used to at the bakery) and baked them that way, without shaping them.  After they came out of the oven, I drizzled them with a vanilla/confectioner's sugar icing.  Thy were very sweet this way, but just what I was looking for. The sour cream gave them a great flavor and texture,",

These turned out great but were not exactly like the submitted recipe.  I had recently eaten an orange cranberry scone at a Fresh Market and loved it and was trying to duplicate the flavor.  These are even better!  My changes included subbing orange Craisins and adding 1 1/2 tsp. orange zest, lite sour cream, fat-free evaporated milk (for richness), and omitting the egg wash.  They were so soft that I dropped them - 12 - onto a parchment lined baking sheet and sprinkled them with natural sugar crystals.  Fabulous!  They were full of flavor, not heavy, and crunchy on the outside.  My husband tasted them and has requested one with his lunch today (his first scone).  Next tiime, I will make 24 smaller scones and share them with friends.  This is not scone country so they will be a novelty!",

                "reviewBody": "This could be a very good recipe, if you did not use so much baking powder.  I first tried this recipe, omitting all baking powder, but using self-rising flour instead.  The scones turned our wonderfully then. Because they were so good I decided to bake more, this time following the recipe EXACTLY, and they all risen too much, and they had a horribly bitter after taste. I will still keep this recipe, but from now on I will only use self rising flour.",
