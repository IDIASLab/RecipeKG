I thought the dressing favored the sweet as opposed to the sour side as I found the sugar to temper the sharpness of the vinegar (I happen to like vinegar so to someone else it may taste otherwise). I added half a green bell pepper which was plenty and next time will add onion too. After thawing I found the slaw surprisingly to still be crunchy even though freezing and thawing changed that of the original fresh texture, the change was not a negative.",

We are both so happy with your version.  I made a small batch and two days later made a large batch.  I thawed two half cup containers two days ago, crispy and still awesome. Thanks again!",
