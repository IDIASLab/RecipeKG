For me, I multiplied the recipe by 5 and ended up with 31 jars of jam.  (Good thing it turned out to be such a great jam!) I will say that it is the best jam I have ever tasted, not just made! The only thing I tweaked was that I put in a bit less suger, just as the recipe suggested. Other than that, don't change a thing.\n\nAnother note - I put the crystallized ginger in teh food processer and ended up with a gooey lump.  It melted once I brought it to a boil, but its probably better to hand chop this.",

I've made it exactly, and almost exactly, so a few notes...\n\nIf you don't like sweet, or your peaches are very ripe, start out with HALF the sugar, and then taste it.  You can keep tasting and adding until it seems right to you without hurting the jam at all.\n\nI used a large piece of thinly sliced and chopped ginger, about the length of my finger.  Since we really like ginger, it's almost impossible to put too much in.  (But if you're worried, you can do the same 'taste and add more' as with the sugar.  Except, remember that as the jars sit and cool, the ginger flavor will get more intense.)\n\nIf you don't like chopping, cut the peaches into halves/quarters, and use a food processor to chop.  Just pulse a couple of times, and don't over process.  One or two large chunks won't kill anyone.\n\nI also tried this with jalapenos and chile peppers, and am not disappointed.  Claudia, thanks for a great easy recipe!",
