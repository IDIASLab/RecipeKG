I struggled with the cooking process but that's inexperience. Used 2 spatulas for turning and removing from the pan. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I had to add a LOT more lemon juice to the vinaigrette. Next time I'd use 1/4 cup of oil instead of 3/4. Personal taste....",

The ginger lemon and cayenne is a great combination...no more cocktail sauce crab cakes in this establishment. This is a 5 star",
