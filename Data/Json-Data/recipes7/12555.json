Of the entire pan, only two small corner pieces were left after I had friends over. I'm sure if I didn't have other food to eat, this would have been devoured! I couldn't wait to cut into this because the house was completely enveloped with the smell of brownies with cinnamon sugar. The taste did not disappoint at all. I'll be making this easy dessert again! \n\nThank you for the great recipe!",

Only changes I made, (and I made them only because I didn't have the exact ingredients) I subbed light brown sugar for dark brown and I didn't do the glaze (which in my opinion doesn't need) because I didn't have heavy cream on me. I left it in the oven for 40 minutes but my oven is wonky. I love, love, love it! Definitely doing this again!!!! Great recipe!",
