I also used real butter at room temp so maybe that helped? I added fresh jalapenos on one side of the pan, I have kids, and im so pleased with how moist it turned out, sweet and authentic flavors. Its not so sweet like cake but pretty close to it! The jalepenos really do compliment it!",

We have to make it dairy-free due to food allergies so we used 2 small cans of Cream of Coconut in place of the sweetened condensed milk and Earth Balance in place of the butter though we have used coconut oil with great results. We do not add the extra sugar because we feel like it's sweet enough with the coconut cream. We also modify with one can of corn and 2 cans of cream-style corn. Very moist and rich perfect for serving with soup. Sweet with a good depth to it. I even ate it for breakfast a few mornings!",
