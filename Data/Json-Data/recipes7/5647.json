I was looking to make a cooked spiced peach recipe for a topping to put on Greek yogurt so I found this and worked with it. I cooked the water sugar and honey in a saucepan and added frozen peaches (found a bag on sale) and all the spices in ground form until heated through. I let it all cool and spooned some over my yogurt and MMMMMMMM! The combination was just what I was looking for. I am thinking of venturing into the world of canning and when I do I will turn to this recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "To prevent browning of the peaches during the peeling process, keep peeled peaches in acidified water. Mix 1 teaspoon ascorbic acid crystals or finely crush six 500 mg Vitamin C tablets in one gallon of water. You can also use a commercial anti-darkening product by following the manufacturer\u2019s directions.\n\nPeaches may be packed into the jars raw or hot. Raw packing is a safe method but generally results in a poorer product than hot packed peaches. Raw packed peaches float to the top of the jar, and the jars usually lose a lot of the juice (along with flavor) through siphoning. When siphoning occurs, tiny food fibers sometimes get lodged between the jar and the sealing compound of the lid causing sealing failure. Because air is driven out of the tissues of the raw peach when it is heated, hot packed peaches are less likely to float, more peaches fit into the jar, and the juice is less likely to boil out when jars are removed from the canner.",
