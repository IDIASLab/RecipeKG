Oddly we became aware of this jam through the TV show The Blacklist, where it was featured in an episode in the 2nd season, and we just happened to have roses in bloom at that very moment. I made a batch, it turned out delicious and unique, so it has become added to our family culture. To me it tastes like a blend of cherry and strawberry, which suits it well to its traditional role as a filling for paczki and other pastries. The one tip I actually picked up from The Blacklist, which this recipe leaves out, is to add some rum to the lemon juice for marinating the petals, about 1.5 to 2 oz.  With that added, this is simply a delightful recipe which I think everyone who owns or has access to roses should do at least occasionally, making something wonderful out of that which otherwise goes to waste.  The aroma is delicate and the ruby red is entrancing.",
