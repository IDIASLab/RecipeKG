But it may also be eaten on its own like a cake. Because it is so delicious yet simple to put together, it makes a great food gift or potluck contribution. Substitute raisins for dates, if you wish.",

Since there were no reviews I decided to halve the recipe to try it out. DELICIOUS! My dates were already bought chopped and were slightly sugar coated in the package. I decided to cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup (halved recipe) to make sure the bread was not too sweet. I used 2 \"mini\" loaf pans and baked on 350 for 45 minutes. They were slightly darker than I would have liked them to be so next time I will start checking at 35 minutes (this may allow an even moister bread). The bread is slightly dense moist and has a nice sweetness with the dates. Personally I would 'not' add cream cheese on top because I think the bread is sweet enough on its own.",
