                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe exactly as written. (Well to be precise the package of ground beef I used was 2.01 lb.) The beef used was 90% lean the beans were light red kidney beans and the black pepper was freshly ground. I also opted for the habanero and the sugar. I cooked the chili for only 45 minutes (the low end of the range given in the recipe) because I was really hungry. This was also the first time I'd ever cooked with both masa harina flour and a fresh habanero. I thought this chili was okay but I guess I'll only give it a 3-star rating because the competition is fierce in the chili-recipe world. Corn is not a common ingredient in chili and though I like corn in general I would've rather it hadn't been in this chili. On the other hand the masa harina made the chili somewhat thick which is a plus in my book since I hate watery chili. The chili had a somewhat undesirable sweetness to it so if I make this again I wouldn't add the \"2 tsp. white sugar\" after all. Lastly I used my new electric chopper (not quite a full-fledged food processor) for the first time and with only a few \"pulse\"s the vegetables were pretty finely chopped. Next time I would chop or mince the veggies by hand since I prefer chili to have a little chunkiness to it vegetable-wise. In summary this chili was decent pretty meaty and fairly hot with the added habanero. I think I will make another batch of this since I have the other half of the red onion left and with the changes mentioned",

I followed the recipe as stated except for the jalapeno or habanero peppers. I was concerned to would be too spicy for some of the kids eating dinner with us. I did serve the peppers on the side for those to add to their bowls. I felt the chili was very thick. I kept adding water every 15 minutes to try and thin the sauce some. Next time I may add an additional can of tomato sauce. It definitely had some heat even without the peppers.",
