That being said it would be helpful if the recipe indicated that butter should be softened or melted before mixing. I added a little water to the batter because it seemed really dry and that led to sticky cookies that burned on the bottom. I would say the amount of sugar in the recipe could be decreased as well. In short don't make the mistakes I did!",
