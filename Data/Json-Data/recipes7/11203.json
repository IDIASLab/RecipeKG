        "description": "A classic vanilla cake with a twist! This recipe was actually a creative mistake. I was trying to make up a decadent chocolate cake, and had already added in the cinnamon, when I discovered that I was out of cocoa powder! I decided to continue to make this recipe and was shocked when it turned out! This recipe is pretty special to me because it was the very first recipe I actually made up myself. The honey in the frosting adds a hint of an interesting sweetness, even though with a teaspoon you can't taste it. For a more obvious honey flavor, add up to 1/3 cup (or to taste) of honey.",

After forgetting one egg and having a hard time getting the icing to what I considered a good consistency this cake is fantastic even with those few accidents. Mind you this is the first time I have made homemade icing and decided to give it a go. I think perhaps it calls for a bit too much butter in the icing and not quite enough powdered sugar. So you may want to work a bit with that ratio. I also made my cake in a 9 x 13 glass baking dish and it worked perfect. Otherwise I did this to the letter (except the extra egg of course LOL) and loved it. It does indeed taste like a snickerdoodle. Added to the recipe box.",

The cake came out a little dry but I'm not sure if that is due to my recipe change or 25 min may have been too long for my oven so I'm not deducting any points for that. Anyway it is still quite enjoyable! I doubled the frosting recipe which I reccommend for the 2 layer cake because I had just enough frosting left over to do a little piping around the edges and I don't think it would have been enough to cover the cake otherwise. It was perfect spreading consistency and I didn't even need to add any milk. But I think next time I will add more honey and decrease the butter a bit and add some milk or cream to get that good consistency but that's just a personal preference most buttercream recipes are too buttery for me.",
