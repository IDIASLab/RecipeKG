I boiled the syrup in the microwave in a glass measuring cup for easy cleanup (about 10 minutes) I also used a stand mixer.It made SOOO much frosting though. It frosted a whole sponge tube cake (glorious sponge cake from this site)with enough frosting so you could not see the hole (at least 2 inches of frosting) and had enough left over for a whole large cool whip container. I would try half the recipe next time. My son has alread requested orange jello frosting. So much easier than traditional seven-minute.",

I used unrflavoured gelatin and added a little vanilla to the finished product and it tasted exactly like marshmallow (except even better!) The author is right when she says to use it right away. I put it in the fridge for a little while to use for later and it set up so that it was too thick to spread. But heating it gently over some simmering water in a double boiler got it thin enough so that I could spread it. I also used it as a \"cream\" filling for some chocolate cupcakes and every body loved it. Thank you your mom!",
