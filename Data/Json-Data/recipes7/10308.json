This version is the best by far as I love pineapples! I used organic cane sugar in place of white sugar and used 2 cans of crushed pineapple which gave me 2 cups of pineapple juice for the syrup base. I used 3/4 of the remaining crushed pineapple and this dish was spectacular. Will be a favorite for many years to come!",
