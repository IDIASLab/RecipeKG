So easy to make, but yet elegant enough for company or a fancy dinner. I used half of a vanilla bean (just cut is in half and then scraped out the seeds and added them to the cream, and threw the bean in there as well). I didn't measure the gelatin, just used 1 of the little Knox gelatin packets, which I guestimated was about 1-1/2 tsp. It set up perfectly, and the stewed strawberries were a delicious topping for this. Will make this one again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",

I had some fresh blueberries from my little bush so I made a sauce out of them and strained out the seeds and served it with that and a few fresh berries. I did make a couple of small changes to the recipe. I used Vanilla Extract to taste. I bloomed the gelatin in 1/2 cup of cold milk which was added to the cream mixture after the sugar melted as it seemed like too much gelatin for such a small amount of liquid. I did not use the water. I used a little more sugar and little less chocolate and I added a tablespoon or so of white vinegar to give it a bit of tartness. (A recipe trick I learned from some cooking show). Makes it taste a bit like buttermilk panna cotta without the buttermilk. My boyfriend loved it. I hate panna cotta so you'll have to take his word for it. He is the expert and he was licking the molds. Me I hate the taste of boiled milk so I can't judge a good one from a bad one. I will be making this for him again. Next time I'll try the strawberries. Thank you.",

Most likely due to the white chocolate. The vanilla paste was really expensive so I just used regular extract.  I splurged this week and plan to make it again with the vanilla paste. I think that will give the custard base a little more zing.",
