I reduced the amount of flour from 2 cups to 1  3/4 cups. I added 1 tablespoon of water. Instead of \"crushing\" the almonds, I ground them in the food processor. These small changes were worth it. My dough was soft and easy to work with. Reviewers mentioned that the cookies mostly retain their shape during baking, so I pressed the balls very gently on the cookie sheet to flatten them slightly.  And just for fun, I pressed a slivered almond on top of each cookie for decoration.  They came out perfectly. I might increase the sugar next time since I have a sweet tooth.",

The trick is to let them cool completely at least an hour before you even touch them. They will harden and not fall apart if you let them cool. I then brushed them very lightly with powdered sugar.
