I only wish that I had remembered to take a picture of it.  Also, when I set these to marinade I didn't get a chance to cook it the next day so they marinated for 2 days and were so flavorful but the flavor still didn't overpower the lamb.  It complimented it very well.  Also, if you're cooking the 15 as the recipe calls for, I would increase the amount of marinade so that there is plenty to go over all of it.  I used the recipe as stated for 4 chops and there wasn't much left over.  Thanks for this recipe!",

Marinating overnight is best, but I\u2019ve also had good results with five hours. We serve it with a robust salad, but if you\u2019re really hungry you\u2019ll want another side. It\u2019s also a great dish for company. I would just note, however, that the cilantro and lime are what really make this recipe Vietnamese. Leaving off those items gives you a great piece of lamb; changing the toppings could easily adapt the dish to another cuisine. ",
