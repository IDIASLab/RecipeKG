It would be fun to put it into candy molds and then drop a few into a mug before pouring coffee/espresso on top. However it says syrup and it's really not a syrup as written. Table sugar won't begin to brown until over 300 F but the mixture can't rise above 212 F until after the water is boiled off. Thus the resultant slurry will be very thick at room temperature. It might help to brown the sugar first and then add the cream only cooking a bit longer after adding it.",
