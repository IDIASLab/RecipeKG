The only changes I made were to use a 9 inch springform pan as some reviewers suggested, which I think was good for this amount of batter, and to take out a tablespoon of the flour and use it to coat the strawberries so they didn\u2019t sink to the bottom. The sugar on top was genius, as it turned into a crisp crust.  The only problem was that, because it cooked so long, the strawberries sort of turned into mush.  Because of this, I\u2019d consider chopping the strawberries slightly smaller, maybe quarters or eighths for larger berries.  I also think this would be great with other fruits, like peaches, cherries, blueberries, etc.",
