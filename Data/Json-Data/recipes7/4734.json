For one thing, I used a regular pie crust, poked it with a fork, and baked it before adding the filling.  Graham crackers just seemed a little off.  My favorite thing that she did was spread 4 ounces of cream cheese on the warm crust before placing in the halved fresh strawberries.  To me this is a MUST!  I also threw in some blueberries because I was a little short on strawberries.  My husband and I loved this pie.  It's a hard one to mess up-- just be patient and make sure that glaze is nice and thick, stirring it constantly!!  I posted pictures to show the nice color added by the blueberries.  This was a pretty pie.",

I omitted the rhubarb because we don't really like it and increased the strawberries in the sauce by 1/2 cup. If I made it again I would bake the crust for 15 minutes to set it up better. It's tough to serve and leaves behind most of the crumbs. Still we loved it and will make it again.",
