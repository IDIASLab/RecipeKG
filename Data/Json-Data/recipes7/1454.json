I understand the confusion with the 'glaze', they called it something it is NOT.  This technique is used to make dessert cakes that are soaked with some kind of liquor/spirit. By all means adjust the rum if you want (it's your cake) but try to pour all of the 'soak' over the cake(remember, it is NOT a glaze). It is supposed to be a 'wet/moist' cake.   Also, using a Bundt style pan doesn't help because the liquid just runs over the sides instead of going into the cake, even if you make the holes.  These things will help: 1) Using one of the traditional pans where the bottom is flat (the top when you invert it) so that the liquid goes through better. Another thing that works also, no matter which mold you use: 'unmold' the cake, wait until the pan and the cake cool enough, line the pan with plastic Wrap and return the cake to it. Then pour the liquid over the cake bottom (having made holes in it). Once the liquid is all absorbed, wait about 10 min and unmold.  2) Making this the day before so that all the flavors and textures blend nicely.  3) Not cooking the liquid just until the sugars are dissolved, but simmer it a little bit longer. 1 minute more in med heat is fine. This eliminates some of the 'bite' of the rum because the alcohol evaporates. But don't overcook the liquid because you could end up with burnt sugar :-).",

No it doesn't have a glaze either--it's a soaking syrup, but it's a wonderful soaking syrup so who cares what it's called? To get the moisture where it should be in the cake, after you remove the cake from the oven let it cool in pan about 20 minutes. Gently remove the cake and set aside. Pour the sugar/rum/butter syrup into the bottom of the Bundt pan and then place the cake back into the pan. Let it sit 20-30 minutes, and then turn the Bundt pan, cake still in it, upside down onto a plate to unmold. BTW, I skipped the coconut and instead added a 20-oz can of crushed, DRAINED pineapple to my syrup so that the cake turned out like pineapple upside down cake. It was a huge hit--moist, poundcake-like, and not too sweet or rummy (I used 1/2 c rum). I will use this basic recipe (without syrup) from now on for a quick and easy, start-from-a-box, tastes-like-homemade pound cake.",
