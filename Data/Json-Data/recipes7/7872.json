I halved the recipe since I only bought one pound of ground beef (85/15) but kept the amount of green onions the same. Delicious.",

I served them with sesame noodles but most of my family ate them on hamburger buns. Personally I think the bread hid the bulgogi flavor (my favorte part) so I just cut mine up and ate it by itself. For my family of 5 to all agree on a dish is a big deal so I will certainly make these again....thanks for the great recipe!",
