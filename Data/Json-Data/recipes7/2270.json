I thought I'd try freezer jam because I'd wanted to branch out slowly. This recipe was super simple and halved easily. I added about 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Nothing else was changed. This recipe turned out perfectly. I'm very pleased. I bet this would work well with local Rainier cherries and pineapple as well. \n\nEDITED 08/07/08: I made this today with the first pickings of blackberries and a package of strawberries. I used the Blackberry Fusion Jello to thicken it. Woo, is that GOOD! Incredibly easy, too!",

Try on Belgian waffles. Made up a cookie bar with this that turned out great. Mix a box of sugar cookie dough as per directions press into 13 x 9 pan and bake per directions on box. remove from oven and let cool In a med bowl beat 1 box of cream cheese 1 box of vanilla instant pudding and 1 cup of milk until smooth. spread over sugar cookie crust. Spoon rhubarb jam over cream cheese. Put in fridge for 1 hour. Cut into bars. Company and kids LOVED it.",
