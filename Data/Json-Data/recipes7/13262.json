But instead of using standard pie crust dough, I decided to try something a little more rustic and savory, using spelt flour and olive oil. I knew this would pair beautifully with the sweet fruit and tangy cheese, but it ended up being way too crumbly. So, I just crumbled it into the bottom of a shallow ramekin and the rest is history.",

I used fresh figs and maybe they weren't juicy enough but I felt the dish was dry trying to eat it.  it really needs a fig or balsamic reduction drizzled over the top to set this dish to 5 star level.  I will definitely try again and add the reduction.",
