I also read that self rising flour works better for bagels so I used that as well. The dough was very dry tough and hard to work with. It also didn't seem to rise during the first 15 rest. They were tough to shape and then hardly rose even after 40 min. They puffed up while boiling which was good and baked well. Will definitely make again with some changes that are more like the actually recipe lol:)",

The flavor is delicious, though not as close to the bagels I'm accustomed to eating. I halved the recipe, made 5 giant bagels, boiled for 50 seconds, put a little coarse corn meal on the tray, did each rise an additional 10 minutes than written and baked for 25 minutes. The bagels are perfectly chewy on the outside, crisp on the bottom, and the right density texture inside. I ate one just out of the oven with butter, and then I pan fried the second and ate with cream cheese! Absolutely delicious!",

I used bread machine yeast kosher salt and warm water and kneaded 12 minutes or so to get it elastic and smooth (it was never perfectly smooth). You really can just punch a hole in these bagels. I shaped mine with wide holes expecting the holes to get smaller as in other recipes I've tried but they never closed up. After boiling I put an egg white/water mix on top of some bagels and topped with various mixes. On metal baking sheets with a convection oven it took about 20 minutes to cook the bagels. On a ceramic (I think) Pampered Chef pan it took 25 minutes. I can't get over how fast and easy these were! Thanks for the recipe!",
