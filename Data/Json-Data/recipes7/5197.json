I'm not the biggest fan, particularly when it comes to any type of sausage but I just tasted this and it's absolutely delicious! I didn't have kielbasa in the house so I subbed with bratwurst and added some caraway seeds to the mix. Cooking wise, I did brown my wurst first and then added my potatoes and the rest of the ingredients. No layering here, just threw it all together.  The combination of flavors is everything one would expect from a good German dish and I know this will definitely go down as a family favorite. Thank you DJ!",

I do have to admit that we used vegetarian faux kielbasa (my husband is a vegetarian), and that provided most of the flavor, so using real kielbasa would almost certainly make some sort of difference.  I will certainly try this again using real kielbasa for myself, but I think I'll only use half of a cabbage. I got the smallest cabbage I could find at the store, but it was still too much for me personally. I love onion, though, so I'll use a whole one next time. Thanks for the recipe!",

My son loved the kielbasa and potatoes.  Kielbasa always tastes good cooked in beer, and the vegetables were good cooked in the beer too.  But I think the onion would be better in large chunks instead of chopped.  I doubled the carrots, onion and red potatoes and thought it didn\u2019t look like enough beer in the pot, so I added another bottle.  But in the end, I think one bottle would have been fine because even the cabbage (only half covered in the beer) cooked up great with the lid on the pot.  I did not layer the ingredients; I just mixed everything together except for the cabbage which I was trying to keep in the quartered chunks.",
