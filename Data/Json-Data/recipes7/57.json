I'm not sure why the recipe says to mix the jello/water and sugar/water separately - I did it all at the same time, and it was fine. This tastes really good with cherry jello and pineapple juice, lemon jello and orange juice, and orange jello and mango juice. It's kinda fun experimenting. Thanks!",

I also took it out of the freezer about 1 hour ahead of time to allow it to thaw a little bit so it wasn't a huge ice chunk in my punch bowl. Also it takes a good 8 hrs to really freeze up so making this a day ahead of time is a really good idea. Overall a very good punch:)",

Bring out your bags to thaw at least 3-4 hours ahead and leave at least 2 on the kitchen counter and 2 in a cooler to thaw. I followed the recipe exactly. The slush is wonderful with the ginger ale.

I would love to add the rum as suggested and will probably do that when I make this for a more informal party in my home. If I serve it and it goes over I'll add some more notes... The timing was a little difficult but this made plenty of punch for 30 people plus some for an \"after\" party with the rum added later to do invitations no one spilled all over even on the invitations lol. I took the frozen zip-lok bags of punch out early-about 8 AM then put them in a large igloo beverage cooler to transport with the Ginger ale @ 9 AM and got a good consistency by the time lunch was served. Had to bust up the big hunks of frozen stuff but it worked out ok. Better plan on a punch bowl. You can't pour this well or use a spiggout because it filter out all the slushy ice which is key in the overall enjoyment of the beverage. Overall a little complicated but good pay-off factor.",
