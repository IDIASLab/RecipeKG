I halved the recipe, and used low fat sour cream, then I added the juice of 1 1/2 lemons to the batter, I tasted the batter to make sure it had the tang of lemon before I was satisfied.  I used the full recipe for the crumb topping, in other words doubled it for a halved recipe. When the muffins came out of the oven I drizzled a glaze of fresh squeezed lemon juice and powdered sugar over the top and in the crevices of the warm muffins, it made them even moister and more lemony.  I will make this recipe over and over for my family and gifts for friends.  If you love lemon you will love these changes.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was originally published in Taste of Home and I noticed that it leaves out the most vital step of the whole muffin experience! There is supposed to be a Lemon Juice/Sugar syrup that you drizzle over the warm muffins. Believe me, this is so important to make these muffins top notch. They already have a beautiful texture and light lemon flavor, but the sweet tang of the syrup takes these over the top! For the full batch, the original TOH glaze recipe calls for 1/2 cup sugar and 1/3 cup lemon juice. Mix to dissolve the sugar, then drizzle over your warm muffins. I sometimes warm the sugar syrup in the microwave a bit to dissolve the sugar, and I always drizzle the muffins while they are still in the pan because this sends the syrup down the sides of the muffin and creates a wonderful experience in your mouth when you finally have a bite! Plus, it's less messy overall, keep the mess in the pan right! They are easy to take out of the pan, too! I made the entire batch one day and couldn't bake them all that evening, so I saved the remaining batter overnight and baked them the next morning and I had no issues with them rising at all. Also, if I have plain or flavored yogurt to use up, I use that in place of the sour cream. I've made these many times according to the recipe and I find that I like more lemon flavor, so I add 2 - 3 tsp of Lemon Extract to the batter with a little more lemon juice as well. Very forgiving recipe and freezes well!",

I prepared exactly as the recipe stated except I added a little extra lemon juice because it did not seem lemony enough. I also thought the crumble was a little powdery. I think it needs a touch more butter to make it more of a crumble. The batter is unbelievably thick so don't think you did anything wrong once you make it. Based on other reviews I made a simple syrup with 1/3 cup lemon juice and 1/2 cup sugar and drizzled over some of the muffins while they were hot. The ones that had the drizzle were definitely better than the ones that did not. They were slightly dry and they were definitely not overcooked. The texture is heavier than a typical muffin but still good. I would make these again but drizzle a little extra of the simple syrup I made on them next time and that may help with the dryness. I think it would be better with a little extra lemon zest added also.",

I increased the heat to 425 degrees and baked about 20 minutes for a nice rise on the muffins. also added finely chopped pecans, bout 1/2 a cup to the recipe. since i was low on sour cream, i subbed vanilla yogurt and sour milk. also, i used oil in place of the butter in the muffin batter. next time i will use only two eggs, though- it was a little dense.   will make these again!",
