I couldn't find it directly on Allrecipes though, which was strange since I entered into the search section and I use Allrecipes a lot!  I found it on a google search using pork picnic and then it brought me back here.  Anyway, really delicious, tender, simple...I probably added more garlic than what was called for, but otherwise, did it the same.  Thank you for great recipe!",

We thought this recipe was bland - but my garlic was on the old side so I may try it again with fresh garlic.  I think it needs something else - perhaps cook it with french onion soup instead of beef broth or add thyme and sage with the garlic.  We enjoyed it but prefer more flavor.",

Didnt have potatoes so swapped for instant mashed instead. Still used the carrots and onions. Made a nice gravy out of the onion garlic broth left over. Asparagus was our veggie. Very simple recipe. 3 lb roast took 3 hours on high. Not too salty. Not bland either.",
