So far, I've stayed with the Very Hot (475-F) oven and bake to color, a bit less time than called for.  I'm tickeled with the interior textrure and flavor.  If there is one BIG variation, I mix the dough in the evening, oil it very lightly and let it ferment in the fridge for 12-18 hours, allowing about two hours at room temperature to warm before dividing and forming the bagels.

I let the yeast get frothy and then added in the salt, oil and 4 cups of flour (anymore and it would have been too dry!). On speed 2, I let it mix then knead the dough for 15 minutes. I was running late, and couldn't get the dough to the consistency as instructed. It broke almost right away when pulled. I popped the dough a warm oven (I put it on 350F just until the elements were red, then turned it off).\nAfter rising for 2 hours, I punched down the dough and started shaping. I made 8 bagels. I didn't have a full cup of honey, so I added some light corn syrup to make up for what I was lacking, a quarter cup. I also didn't use 16 cups of water, I used 13. I let the bagels bathe and then topped them with grated medium cheddar cheese. They baked for 20 minutes at 475F. I pulled them out, let them cool for 15 minutes then tried them. OMG! Delicious! They will be even better with cream cheese smothered over them after toasting them in the toaster! I can't wait for breakfast tomorrow! Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

To make only 6 bagels would have resulted in rings the size of bread loaves.  I made 18.  12 would have been on par with the generously over-sized bagels in grocery stores.  \n\nThe flavour is bland.  One reviewer said he leaves the dough to ferment overnight with a long, slow rise.  I think that would be wise. Otherwise the taste is flat.  These need some sort of topping or schmear, rather than eating them on their own.",

I also mixed the dough in my bread machine, it's just easier that way. The recipe is exact to my pizza dough 1 and 1/2 water, 2 tbsp oil, 4c bread or high gluten flour, 1tsp salt(sprinkle about that much) and 3 tbsp sugar(a handful), and 1 pkt rapid rise yeast. I decided to go with Onion bagels, so I added onion powder to the dough (about a few tbsp, just sprinked, so dont know the exact amount) . Once the dough was finished I took the advice of adding honey to the water(not sure if it made any difference, just used up a bunch of my honey). It is just like making pretzels or pretzel dogs I dropped them in the water and flipped after about 30 or so seconds then placed them onto a parchment lined baking sheet. I brushed the top of each with egg white then sprinkled with onion flakes. I then baked in a 400 oven for about 20 minutes checking after 15 then every few minutes until they looked done. I turned the oven off, opened the door and covered with foil. I have learned from making, pizza and pretzles that this helps the chew in the crust. Now I just have to keep from eating them all before the rest of the family comes home.",

They were my first attempt at bagels so I was happy that they turned out, but they really were huge. I'm going to try again and make 8 instead so they're a more normal size. I was happy with how they tasted right out of the oven, but having one for breakfast the next day, they were a bit bland. I did not boil them with honey, so I will also try that next time to add an extra layer of flavor. Oh, and a bit of advice for anyone having trouble rolling out and connecting their bagels into a ring - I saw in another recipe that they form the bagels into balls and just stick their thumb in the middle to make a hole, then stretch the hole to 1/3 the width of the bagel and form it into a bagel shape that way. I did that and it was very easy. PLAWHON - Thank you very much for contributing this recipe! I was very pleased with how easy to follow it was for a novice baker.",
