Fennel is what I\u2019ve been missing all of this time! You seriously have no idea how many times I\u2019ve gone to make a \u201cquick\u201d meal of spaghetti after a day of work i had 2 hungry growing bottomless pit boys screeching that they\u2019re hungry and I realize I am out of the simple jar of spaghetti sauce! So I toss a can of sauce, paste, and crushed tomatoes and have attempted to cobble something resembling the jar. I\u2019ve tried a combo of every single ingredient you\u2019ve listed except for the fennel! You dear lady, are a genius! In the past, the method was: tiny taste, hmmm bland, maybe more oregano? Taste. Nope still bland. More Italian seasoning! Taste. Nope. More basil. Taste. Nope. Thyme is kinda Italian, right? Taste. Nope. This would continue until the boys started gnawing on my leg and I\u2019d give up. They would immediately eat everything in sight and be happy because they are boys that didn\u2019t care what it tasted like because FOOD! It was me who wasn\u2019t satisfied. Fennel was the secret ingredient! THANK YOU!! This was awesome! The boys are now adults, so they are no longer garbage disposals masquerading as humans, and they gave this the seal of approval, as did I! FENNEL! I followed this exactly and it was easy and perfect and quite frankly awesome!",

The recipe is very good as is but is also very adaptable. I've altered it many ways almost always starting with browning ground meat (moose elk turkey or beef) omitted fennel seeds sometimes replaced sugar with stevia powder or just skipped it ect. I've made lasagna served it over regular pasta spaghetti squash green beans gluten-free pasta. All were wonderful. Today I intend to attempt it in my slow cooker. I'll update with how it turns out.
