I did miss the coconut but the walnuts were a nice substitute. Although i like the taste of dark and rich chocolate i found the top layer too cocoa-y tasting. Overall i enjoyed the bar but longed for a bit more sweetness but possibly just because im used to them being overpoweringly sweet. On the other hand my bars looked AMAZING i made sure to let the top layer get extra cool before spreading and they were absolutely flawless in every layer very tidy and professional looking!",
