I am wondering if that might be a typo so I brushed the fish with the honey mustard and then topped with the panko mixture. The fish was really tasty and I would make it again. I am wondering if there might have been another typo in adding 1 tbsp. of garlic powder to the yogurt mixture. It had a very strong garlic taste and a slight powdery texture from so much garlic powder. I made a second batch with less garlic powder and added a little lemon juice to thin it out and it was very tasty. I also added some finely chopped green onion instead of chives because that is what I had in my refrigerator. I am typically not a fan of instant mashed potatoes but the addition of butter and milk to the potatoes made them creamy and had great flavor. Thanks for recipe!",
