Thanks for sharing- I will make again, although I may reduce the hot chili oil next time. I served over rice, and it was delicious!",

I didn't use the hot chili oil or the red pepper flakes because I was suiting tastes to a 1 and 3 year old and I actually used beef broth instead of the chicken stock because it was expiring soon:) We'll definitely make this again! I also think it would be a pretty easy recipe to prep the meat ahead of time when it goes on sale and keep it frozen for later use. Thanks!",

Always my favorite dish while having the priviledge to work for 2 years in a chinese restraunt. This is as close as it gets..maybe better. It's meant to be hot..manage the heat with the chile/seasame oil, we use whole dried chile peppers on \"step two\" of the recipe and you can simply crush red peps and put them in seasame oil to  make your own hot oil. this makes it easier to find your prefered heat level for next time. We did not use char but what a perfect place for it. Topped with maifun rice sticks and of course Jasman rice on the side. Peanut oil is also a key ingredient. Flash cook the meat very hot dont over do it. Thanks for this great recipe",
