This was also very easy with very little clean up. I did use a regular round cake pan (the caramel will probably leak with a springfoam) and I lined the bottom with parchment paper so that the glaze didn't stick. I couldn't appreciate the pear flavor as much as I would have liked so next time I will use fresh instead of canned. This will be a staple cake for the holidays! Thanks for posting.",
