Red delicious apples cooked down and paired with the cranberries to have a nice sweet-tart balance. Since I had no walnuts on hand I used pecans and it turned out delicious! As other reviewers noted it did take longer to bake than listed in the recipe (50 minutes to bake in my counter-top oven). I will be making this again and might even throw a whole cup of cranberries in to give it a bit of added tartness.",
