I also sauteed the onion in coconut oil before adding stock and veggies. Thought it had a really good flavor and was hearty. The trick is simmering it till the broccoli and cauliflower start to crumble. This gives the illusion of a thicker soup. For me, that was about 20 minutes.",

Swopped arugula for mustard greens and added purple sweet potatoes which I happened to have on hand.  I saut\u00e9ed unions and garlic and ginger then added the curry, cumin, and turmeric.  After everything was fragrant, tossed in the veg and the broth made from bullion.   Also added about two table spoons of maple syrup instead of raisins.  Cooked in the instantpot under pressure for 10 minutes with quick release.  All veg was very soft; should have pressure cooked it for 8 minutes.  All was tasty. Left it to eaters to add salt and pepper.  Garnished with green onions.",
