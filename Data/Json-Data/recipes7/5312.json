I did not use the graham cracker crust, I just made a simple pie/tart crust (w/ real butter of course) and pre baked it ahead of time.  The flavor was perfect, not too rich, extra light and melt in your mouth fluffy!  Yummmm! The pie was not as set as I would think it should be but I'm sure it's either that I didn't cook/thicken it on the stove long enough or it didn't chill long enough.  My family was so excited to try it we only chilled it for about 3 hours.  I'm making it again tonight and will chill it overnight this time, again using the pre-baked crust.  Now, how do I politely tell my in-laws that I don't want them to bring pumpkin pie to Thanksgiving dinner because we like this one better.  : )",
