I lined the bottom of a deep 9\" fluted pan with parchment paper and poured the blackberry topping on top of the parchment paper. Because this is a rather thick cake batter I scooped the batter onto the topping gently spread with a spatula and baked for 40 minutes. I allowed the cake to cool and turned the cake plate upside down over the cake pan and then flipped it removed the pan and slowly peeled the parchment paper. This cake sliced and served so well. A couple of our guests wanted vanilla ice cream with their serving however I preferred the cake just as it was. Thank you PamelaP for sharing your delicious recipe. I will be making this again and again.",

Anyway I made the batter which seemed too thick for cake and poured it over the cooked berries. It was really thick and not easily spread within the 9 inch pan. Don't worry though because the batter eventually covered the pan top and cooked to a cobbler consistency. I will use a 1/4 cup less brown and white sugar otherwise everything else was fine!",

Initially it was for home but had a last minute dinner to go to so decided to take it along. Safe to say it was a success!! As the other comments said the cake mixture was quite thick and I was worried that there wasn't enough of the mixture. But it turned out fine. The cake was a little dry so I might add a bit more milk next time. It was also a bit sweet so might use a tad less sugar for the cake next time. Definitely would make this again!!
