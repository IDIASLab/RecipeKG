I was drawn to this recipe because of its simple solution to the problem with adding the egg to the warm cream. Other recipes intimidated me because of so many reviewers stating that they got little chunks of egg that they had to strain out. I really had no desire to deal with that. I'm not entirely confident that the egg yolks are thoroughly cooked but I'm not one to be picky about that either. I did taste the warm mix before putting it in the fridge and it's fantastic! I flavored it with 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 2 tablespoons of instant coffee. It has a slightly strong coffee flavor I would recommend just a tablespoon and a half for anyone new to the world of coffee ice cream. I plan to add Heath bars for the final product.",
