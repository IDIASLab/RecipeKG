I had to modify it somewhat based on what I had on hand.  I didnt have an orange, so added a tiny bit of lemon zest.  The only diced tomatoes I had on hand had green chiles in them so I used it. It actually made it quite nice with just a tiny spicy bite to it.   I made this in the crockpot and let it cook all day.  I didnt have any boiling onions so used regular yellow onions,  roughly chopped.  I removed some of the liquid after it was cooked and thickened it with flour and added it back in and let it thicken.  We ate it over buttered egg noodles and we all loved it.  I will be making this again.",

Omitted olive oil butter water chopped onion. I heated all ingredients (used 1.5# stew meat) on stove (to give it a heated head start ) then placed in slowcooker. Wasn't sure if the can of diced tomatoes was supposed to be drained or not so didn't drain and omitted the 1/2 cup of water. I added boiling onions a top of other ingredients an hour into cooking so they wouldn't become mushy. Used pearl onions (as stated in recipe) the second time I made & we liked those better---stronger flavour & sweeter than boiling onions. Cooked on low for 4.5 hours however it may have been ready in 3.5-4 hours: The meat was extremely break-apart tender. At the beginning of cook time the aroma reminded me of pumpkin pie (no it doesn't taste a bit like pie)! This dish is very tasty with a nice mellow combination of spice and orange zest. The sauce is very thin when prepared in a slowcooker but simple to thicken. Served with sticky rice but egg noodles or potatoes (mashed or otherwise) would also be a complimentary starch.",

I had 1/2 lb less beef than needed for the recipe, so I used only 1 Tbsp butter and 1/2 lb of pearl onions. Too lazy to peel fresh so I used the frozen pearl onions and still tasted great.  I ended up cooking most of this yesterday and refrigerating overnight, then cooking the pearl onions tonight and simmering them with the reheated stew. Came out fine.  My only suggestion is that though the gravy is wonderful with those spices and the wine etc., there would barely have been enough if I'd used the full 2 lbs of beef, so you might like to increase your liquid.  Thank you for a tasty recipe.  Nice change from my usual beef stews. Served it with broccoli and mashed potatoes, but it would be good with noodles or those tiny European dumplings.",
