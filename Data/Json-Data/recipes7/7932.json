I didn't think the sour cream added anything to the flavor and made the dressing just look like a milky liquid. We all \"eat with our eyes so that was one strike against it. I also think this just had too many different herbs and after chilling for about an hour was soggy and limp. I followed the recipe to the letter and this one just didn't work for us (and this is a house that loves cucumber salads). I'm sorry to be so harsh for the first review but I also want to be honest. And I'll admit that this review could be just a personal taste preference on our part. I'm giving this 3 stars because I don't want to discourage others from trying it but I won't be making this again.",
