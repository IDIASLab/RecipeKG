This recipe does make 12-16 and for my family that is a lot. BUT the leftovers can be thrown in the toaster the next morning and they are still so crispy and yummy good. A lot of recipes claim to make great leftovers well this one really does! These waffles were fluffy and have a slight sweetness. This will definitely be my new waffle recipe to lean on for perfect waffles. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe with us!",
