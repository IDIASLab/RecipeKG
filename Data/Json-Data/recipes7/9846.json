It makes an even 24. Before I added the peaches, the batter seemed far too thick - so much so, that I thought I had made a mistake adding too much flour and I made the batter a second time. The second time yielded the same thick batter result. This is not a problem, just something to be aware of. Once the peaches are added, the batter thins a bit and makes it easier to spoon into the muffin cups.",
