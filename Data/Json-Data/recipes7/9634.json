Cooking as long it did I expected the spice flavor to be completely infused into the liquid but the end result is a very subtle spiciness. I used the 4 lemons called for but it took 4 Tbsp of the concentrate to really get a lemonade flavor so I'll get fewer servings. I do like having a small bottle of the concentrate in the fridge rather than a large pitcher of lemonade taking up valuable space.",
