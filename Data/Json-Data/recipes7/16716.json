Both of those herbs go a long way with us so I didn't want to risk them being overbearing. This turned out really flavorful. I really liked the flavor the parm added but it was pretty much impossible to keep it from sinking to the bottom within seconds of shaking. It adds good flavor though and I think you should include it. This one would be good to keep on hand and it is super simple to make. Thanks for sharing!",
