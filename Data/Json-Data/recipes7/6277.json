I scaled the recipe back and cut the chicken breasts into medallions; therefore I marinated the medallions for 45 minutes and baked it for 30 minutes at 325\u00ba.  I served the chicken medallions over mixed greens so I used the marinade that had cooked and thickened during the baking process as the salad dressing. I didn\u2019t have fresh ginger so I substituted dried ginger and used cider vinegar.  Perfect - can\u2019t get any easier or tastier than this.  Added note:  I made this again cutting them into medallions only this time I grilled them on the grill with excellent results.  It's a fast, easy and tasty dish.",

We grilled our breast on charcoal and I cooked the leftover marinade on the stove top to thicken and baste the chicken. I forgot the tablespoon of water, wasn't needed. Next time I make I might put in a teaspoon of chili sauce and add some minced onion for more flavoring.",

I made half the marinade for two chicken breast halves but I only added the cornstarch to half of it. I marinated in the half without the cornstarch. I heated the other half that included the cornstarch on the stovetop until thickened and bubbly. Hubs grilled the chicken basting with the thickened sauce during the last few minutes which produced some beautiful looking chicken coming off the grill. While we thought this was quite good it may not be our absolute favorite a little too heavy on the soy sauce flavor for us. But that didn t stop us from polishing off every bite!",
