Cakey/biscuit topping with a slight crunch on top and ooey gooey delicious blueberries hidden on the bottom. It can also work with other fruit fillings. Works best with delicious fresh blueberries and is the perfect summer treat.... An amalgamation of mine and my grandmother's cobbler recipe.... I think it is the best! Serve plain or with whipped cream. Enjoy!",

I also agree that there seemed to be too much dough in proportion to the blueberries, and it took much longer to bake than the recipe suggested. Also, I thought the vanilla gave the blueberries an odd, almost artificial flavor--as though it was \"blueberry-flavored cobbler\" and not \"blueberry cobbler.\"  I feel like a cobbler should really highlight the natural, tart taste of a fresh fruit, and this recipe, while it tasted okay, just didn't do that.",

I added 4 tablespoons of flour to the fruit and left everything else just as is. It cooked for 30 min. or so and was heavenly! perfect combo of sweet and tart! I like the juice in it and use the topping to soak it up. YUM! I am making another one now using frozen fruit, lets see how that one turns out! Smells good so far! ",
