DIRECTIONS: Place eggs in pot of cold water. Bring to a boil; boil ten minutes. Remove pot from heat place in sink and run cold water in the pot until eggs are cool enough to handle. Crack peel rinse off any shell pieces and dry thoroughly! Slice in half lengthwise collect the yolks in a medium mixing bowl and set aside the whites. With a fork mash yolks until finely crumbled; stir in sugar salt onion powder garlic powder and pepper. Blend in vinegar mustard mayonnaise and salad dressing one at a time stirring until smooth. Set aside. Set the whites up on a serving plate or tray drying each one thoroughly again with a paper towel as you do. Spoon enough yolk mixture into each white to mound slightly above the cavity. If desired sprinkle with paprika. FOOTNOTES: The older the eggs are the easier they are to peel so the closer they are to the expiration date the better. And yes BOIL the eggs; they're called hardboiled eggs for a reason! That green stuff never hurt anyone and actually a drier egg yolk is a good thing when making deviled eggs.",

The idea of sweet deviled eggs intrigued me. The submitter's directions are spot on for boiling hard boiled eggs--it's how I generally boil mine as well. For anyone who needs any tips on eggs her advice is wonderful. I must say I'm a bigger fan of savory deviled eggs but these were a nice change. I like the cider vinegar and will just cut out the sugar next time--but that's a matter of taste I think. Bf didn't tell me whether or not he liked them but he finished them all off so he must've enjoyed them too. Thank you for the recipe!",
