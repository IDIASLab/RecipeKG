It's been a long road and lots of cupcakes tested and tasted along the way. The trick was NOT using puree as I do when making the frosting. Rather, grinding freeze-dried strawberries into a powder brought this cupcake recipe out of my test kitchen and into my recipe box! I am so pleased with the results!",

I saw this recipe, and thought--when I read about the freeze-dried strawberry powder--\"GENIUS!\" I made them for a BBQ this weekend, but only got 14 cupcakes. I think of my pan as being a standard-sized pan, and I use a scoop for portioning the batter. In any case, I loved these. I made a second batch of chocolate cupcakes (Extreme Chocolate Cake) to bring along with these. I used an Italian meringue buttercream with fresh strawberry puree for the frosting, which was delicious on both flavors. Oh: I used 1/3 cup of the sugar to help grind the strawberries in the food processor (a trick I use when making almond meal or other nut flours), and used the remaining sugar to cream with the butter.",

I emptied the package of freeze dried strawberries into my food processor and found to my dismay that there is a little freshness packet in there that says DO NOT EAT! So that got dumped! Second go at it was much more successful. If you do use a food processor be sure to hold your hand over the top feeder because there is a lot of strawberry dust that needs to settle. I did make my own cake flour since Trader Joe's doesn't carry it and I was out (2 tablespoons cornstarch in a measuring cup and then fill with all purpose flour---sift several times before drawing out the 3/4 cup called for). The cupcakes took 18 minutes to bake. And while they were in the oven I worked on the Real Strawberry Frosting---a total must for these cupcakes! And my verdict is YUM! Thanks so much for a great treat Candice!",

Actually, they were warm when we had our first.  (Hubby made me do it).  I frosted them with \"Real Strawberry Frosting\" from this site which is another of Candice's prize recipes.

They were still good cupcakes and everyone ate them up but they did not have a strong strawberry flavor or even color as I hoped. The disappointing part was that they tasted like freeze dried strawberries -- there is an aftertaste with freeze dried strawberries and it just bugged me a little in these cupcakes. It wasn't pure strawberry. I made the frosting as well and felt that needed more - double - the strawberries. Alas I continue my mission for a true clean strawberry cake taste.:(",
