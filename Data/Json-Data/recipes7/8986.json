I increased the amount of squash to 2 cups, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and best of all, I diced up an apple and folded it into the mixture right before spooning into the cups. Sprinkled a light amount of cinnamon and sugar over the top before baking and they baked in exactly 15 minutes. I ended up with 24 perfect muffins! The apple adds such a nice flavor when you bite into it. With my three guys, these were gone by the end of the day and they want more. Thanks for sharing a really perfect recipe!",

Haha, I also added chopped almonds and 3/4 cup shredded sweetened coconut. Don't forget I soul led this recipe and it made 48 muffins filled 3/4 full, if not a tad more.  Very light moist muffin. I bake continuously and this is the best banana/butternut squash muffin I've ever had. They baked perfectly in 16 minutes. I baked them in cupcake papers. Sooooooo good!!!
