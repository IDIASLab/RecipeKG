                "reviewBody": "I did make some modifications on this recipe but it served as my inspiration for a really nice lunch. I cut way back on the mayo because the amount of dressing for only 1 12 oz package of broc/slaw mix is just too much. I cut the mayo to 1/3-1/2 cup and it was still plenty creamy and enough dressing for the salad. I also subbed rice vinegar (about 2 tablespoons) because it made more sense (to me) with the asian flavor of the sesame oil. I did not use the ramen seasoning packet at all. I'm sorry I just can do it - way too much sodium and the meaty flavor of the packet just doesn't work for me. I did use the full amount of sugar and oil called for. I honestly think that this recipe could have used 2 of the 12 oz packages of the broccoli slaw. I ended up using a bit of red onion and scallions to give this just a bit more color on the plate. Between the ramen sunflower seeds and slivered almonds this salad has a ton of crunch. Next time I will stick with the mods I already made and up it with the extra package of slaw mix. The addition of some chopped cilantro and some julienne red pepper would also add a bit more color. I will also stash this one away in my recipe box for later. I think the addition of some shredded chicken (or cooked shrimp) could easily turn this into an entree salad. Thanks Donna!",
