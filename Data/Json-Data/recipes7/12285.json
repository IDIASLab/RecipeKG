However as I was scooping up the ingredients I realize I didn't want to add ALL that sugar and salt.. so I altered it. I also used Hershey's Cocoa Powder. 10 minutes later I decided to stupidly cut myself a piece to sneak. It started to fall apart oops. Turns out that it needed 15-20 minutes to cool not 10. After they cooled enough for me to hold them I put them in the fridge and freezer (2 separate batches). Freezer ones were a little too hard to bite down later. Fridge was perfect.",
