Next time I am going to cut back on the butternut squash a little and add more parsnips and celery root.  I have never cooked with celery root before but now it's my favorite.  The only thing I would add to this recipe is to stir in herbs.  I used basil and dill and I think it added a little more flavor (not that it was lacking)",

I had no parsnips so used 4 turnips, substituted garlic rosemary bread dipping blend for the salt and pepper.  I added 2 leeks and garlic to the onion, celery, and butter.  I used 2 1/2 Tbls vegetable paste, 1 cup white wine (Chardonnay), and 6 cups of water to make the broth.  Then I added the roasted vegies.  It looked so good as it was that I didn't puree it or add the cream.  It turned out great, will definitely make this again and again.  I had never used celery root but will from now on, and  I will have to try it with the parsnips as I'm sure it will add another great flavor.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

I roasted them @ 350F for 2 hours, stirring once every 25 mins. I then placed the roaster on my stove top, scraped down the sides with a whisk, and while adding the vegetable broth...I pureed it with my hand-held blender. Instead of adding the cream, I served it with a dollop of fat-free sour cream.  Although my guests begged for seconds, I made them hold off until after the 5th course was served. Needless to say I ended up sending them home with the left over soup.",

Some problems I ran into:  Butternut squash roasts to fork tender much more quickly than some of the other things being roasted!  So, by the time I had everything soft, some of the veggies had begun to crisp & brown!  Once I started to puree, it became more \"mashed veggie\" consistency than soup.  I added more broth, ran out of veggie broth...and moved on to chicken broth!  Maybe I had more veggies than called for?  I dislike amounts like \"3 carrots\" instead of 3 ounces, or 2 cups.  The carrots I grabbed were the smallest in the bag, but still larger than others I've bought (farmer's market veggies vs. store veggies?)!  My sweet potato was kind of large, b/c the alternative was 2 very small ones & I thought the big one looked nicer on the outside.  So, maybe I had too many veggies, in the end I just added more liquid to help boost it...but I do think this could use some more herbs.",

Been carrying this around for a while now and finally made it.never cook much with parsnips butternut squash and never with celery root. I pretty much followed the recipe but did take a few hints from the other reviews. I used four parsnips 2 celery roots I did add about a tsp of dried basil a tsp of dill weed. I also used one whole chopped sweet onion and two cloves of minced garlic. Because I increased those items it took almost 1 pint of half and half and almost 32 oz boxes of vegetable broth. The result was creamy smooth and not too sweet and not bitter at all. Warming this soup tomorrow will be fantastic! The only thing that you may want change is cutting up the turnips more as I found cutting them into even eights required more than an hour to cook them through. Thank you! This a unique soup and one to keep!!!",

I did not have celery root and I substituted carnival squash for butternut. I would not make this recipe again. The liquid portions are way off as well. I had to add 3 additional cups of liquid to make it a soup consistence vs. baby food.",
