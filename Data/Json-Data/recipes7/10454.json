I used one head of organic cauliflower, cut into ping-pong sized pieces. Then, in a large bowl, I whisked together: olive oil (probably about 5 tbs), with a touch of garlic infused olive oil, and chile pepper infused olive oil; roughly a tsp of salt, some black pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper (you could use whatever spices/herbs you prefer). Then, I tossed the cut and washed cauliflower(pat dry so oil/spice mix adheres properly) in the oil mixture (try to toss by moving the bowl in a circular motion, instead of using fingers, as this tended to break apart the cauliflower pieces) until everything was coated nicely. I baked this on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper for approx. 45 minutes at 415 degrees, tossing the cauliflower every 15 minutes with a spatula until they became golden-brown, and somewhat blackened on the tippy-tops.(In my opinion, you don't need the sugar or cooking spray). So yummy!!",
