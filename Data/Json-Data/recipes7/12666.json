Since I was trying this for the first time, I just made a small amount using 1/4 t. of cayenne and 1/2 t. of each of the other ingredients, which amounted to cutting the paprika and sugar in half.  I used the entire batch of rub on a one pound pork tenderloin.  Rather than bake this, Hubs grilled it.  It was great!  I\u2019ll make a larger batch and keep it on hand in the pantry.  UPDATE 4/17/16:  I made this again as before, but this time it seemed pretty spicy to Hubs and me.  Next time I will cut the cayenne down to 1/8 t. for this small batch.",

I'm not used to baking pork chops (I usually grill them), and I did let them get a touch overdone.  Be sure to use a reliable thermometer to make sure you get them to no more than 145 degrees!  You will have leftover rub to store for another time, and I'm thinking that the rub will be good on almost any sort of meat (chicken or beef come to mind).  I will grill these next time and use the rub on both sides.  I would definitely use this rub again!  Yum!  Thanks, Ron Perry!",
