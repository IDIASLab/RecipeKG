I left off the mustard but instead made a rub of 3 tsps dried rosemary, a little olive oil and some salt/pepper (not sure on amounts...just to \"taste\").  I took it out after about 1 1/2 hours total because my temperature was 150.  And I loved the flavor I got on the potatoes/carrots due to the basting I did with the beer/juices (hefe) at the bottom.   I wish I would have added more veggies to my pan.",

Also GENEROUSLY add salt and coarse pepper - for my 3lb lamb I used about 5 TBLS of rock salt (rock salt is better for meat rubs I think). As far as coooking time after the first 30 minutes at 400 degrees cook lamb at 350 degrees for about 10-15 minutes per pound. Use 10 minutes as your gauge for medium rare in the middle. For those who like medium they can eat the ends. If you want ends wells done and the middle medium then use the 15 minutes per pound rule. ENJOY!",

This recipe made me feel like a real chef!!! I made this for the first time tonight. I had a 2 lb leg of lamb, but I still used the 30 cloves of garlic. (Actually, I bought an elephant garlic and chopped it into pieces.) Don't be afraid of the garlic! This is the real secret of this dish--the garlic makes it amazing! I also used a lot more vegetables in the roasting pan, including finely chopped celery, green beans, snap peas, and  portabella mushrooms in addition to the potatoes and carrots. Next time I will triple the portabella mushrooms and add garlic cloves to the vegetables.  When I first placed the leg of lamb in the oven, I added olive oil to the bottom of the roasting pan. Towards the middle of the last half hour, I added pats of butter to the vegetables.\n\nOverall, a completely amazing dish. I will be making this very often!",
