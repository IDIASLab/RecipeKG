I'll add to the baking instructions and say that you should bake them until the edges begin to brown and the center seems pale. I take them out when they seem not fully cooked in the center. They set up while cooling. This is the way to be sure they are soft and delicious. Please try them again, taking them out of the oven at the point where the edges are done but the center seems to not be quite done.",

I would probably make them again just because of how easy this recipe is.

I think there may be an error in the ingredients - 2 Tablespoons of vanilla is an awful lot for this kind of recipe - but that is what I used. I wonder if it is meant to be 2 teaspoons. I also tried to cook the bars in my 9x13 inch glass dish at 325 degrees for just 22 minutes as directed but it was still rather wet at 22 minutes. I ended up baking it for 37 minutes to get a light golden brown. I took the bars out of the oven at that point to try to avoid over-baking. Not sure I succeeded. My bars seem rather crumbly and are sticking to the dish. The bars taste okay but are not the texture I was hoping for based on the pictures. The finished bars are much closer to an oatmeal cookie than a chocolate chip cookie.",
