I had to use all of the oat mixture in the bottom of my 9x13- the mixture wouldn't spread the whole way. I also had to add about another 1/2 C applesauce to the filling to have enough for my pan. I made an additional 1/2 serving of topping and baked as suggested. I will make these again.",

The first problem I had is that I do believe these would be better served to make them in an 8x8 pan because there isn't enough of either the topping or the filling to get a good square. I mixed the raspberries with the other filling ingredients but I didn't realize I should have mixed it with a mixer until it was well blended so that could probably be just my error. When I looked at the filling after putting it onto the baked crust I tried to mix it up there so that was another of my errors. My applesauce was maybe too runny because the filling just made everything soggy. I love the idea of these and maybe it is just the way I made them this time. I'm sorry Cheerios! I hope someone will show a photo of how they really should look! I will give them another try!",
