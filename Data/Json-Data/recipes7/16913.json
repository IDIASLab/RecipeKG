And I used a tsp  almond extract and a tsp vanilla extract just to give it a different taste. I also add a half of box of pudding to keep the cake moist since I read one person review about their cake being dry. The caramel icing turned out perfect. I didn\u2019t change anything in the icing. I will say when I make it again I will wait until my cakes are cooling before I make the icing. I didn\u2019t get any pictures the cake was literally devoured the same day. I plan on making it again later today. I will take pictures of the next one!!!",

I would make it again and perhaps not add quite as much confectioner's sugar to the icing.",

                "reviewBody": "The cake was difficult to make. I followed the recipe exactly and my first batch had the consistentlcy of corn bread after cooling. Made it again and cooked it less and it was really dense. Never could get the batter to the ribbon stage despite adding more milk. I altered the icing a bit due to other reviews and it was absolutely amazing!!!! Best caramel icing I ever ate and not grainy at all. More like caramel fudge. I used 3 cups brown sugar 2 cups butter 1/4. 1/8 tsp salt 12 oz evaporated milk 1 pkg confections sugar sifted and 3 tsp vanilla extract. Started frosting the cake about 5 minutes after finishing mixing because even though it s still warm it stiffens quickly. Had plenty of icing to do the whole cake and poured the rest into a little pan to set for fudge!! One more thing don t get disheartened if your cakes sink a tad when they cool because that s makes them easier to ice. The little divot holds the icing while it sets. If I make this again and they come out domed I will cut the tops flat to make them easier to ice. Otherwise the icing will run off before setting.",
