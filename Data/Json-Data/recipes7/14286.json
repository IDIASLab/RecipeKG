With the yogurt included it was too milky for me. I didn't make the veggie cubes but I really like that idea and plan to try it. Instead I just used a little bit of fresh spinach and avocado. It made quite a big serving that I drank for lunch. Thanks! PS: I just realized I forgot to add the blueberries. It made such a large serving I didn't really need them but blueberries would have probably made the color a little prettier.",
