Those that did try it liked it a lot...The good news for me is since there was so much left I have been enjoying it for several days now finally hitting the bottom of the dish 5 days later! And the marvel is it's stayed fresh all this time!!! When I made it I omitted the mushrooms and instead added broccoli flourets. I also used a whole head of iceberg because the spinach at the store looked dreadful.The dressing is simple but compliments this salad well. I used sugar this time but I think in the future I'll subsitiute with Splenda. I will definitely make this again and I will cut down on the peas too. I thought they were a bit overpowering. All in all a wonderfully tasty salad that lasts for days.",
