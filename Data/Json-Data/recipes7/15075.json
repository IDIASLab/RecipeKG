I could have just eaten it with a spoon, it was that good . . . but I really wanted to be able to slice it like fudge, so I put it back into the pan and heated it again to a firm ball stage. It set up just like fudge, and cut well, but it's a bit grainy. I wish I would have just left it at the gooey stage and put it in a jar and used it as an ice cream topping or to add to coffee. Would make again that way, but not as fudge.",

Last part needs to be done quick. Next time I m gonna take of the heat couple minutes before. I did visited a couple of YouTube videos. Lol Not bad for my first try I think some people just didn t let it simmer down enough",
