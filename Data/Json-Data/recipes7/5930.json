Cut the bread, toasted it in the oven, rubbed it with garlic (I didn't think it would give too much flavor by just rubbing-boy was I WRONG) I diced 1/2 of a large shallot-it was a little strong so I took the edge off by sauteing in a pan w/a little evoo added some diced heirloom tomato (saving some fresh dice) sprinkled the toast w/evoo added the saute mixture, topping with the rest of the fresh heirloom tomato and torn pcs of fresh basil......YUM will make again!",
