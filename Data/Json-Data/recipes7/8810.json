All I could taste was kale and grape skins. My grapes were partially frozen so I had to add a tad of water to get my blender to budge. I was thinking the recipe needed another sweet fruit or bananas or something similar to make it creamy. It looked so simple I was hoping it would have worked well to incorporate more kale into the diet. I always find it a difficult green to mask in a smoothie un like spinach. I was able to doctor it up with other fruits though so not a waste. ty",

Mine were slightly tart so my first sip was slightly sour and kinda caught me off guard but overall I'd def make this again because of it's ease. The grapes didn't completely mask the kale flavor for me but I love kale so it's not an issue.",
