Soft and fluffy and so yummy. I would say keep refrigerated as author suggests but take them out about 20 minutes before serving. I wrapped mine individually in waxed paper like candies and twisted the ends. The neighbors loved them too. Definitely going to make these again and again. I would have posted a photo but they disappeared so fast. Great recipe!",

They are not identical to store bought oatmeal cream pies but they are close and taste even better. Two changes I made where to substitute honey for the molasses and light brown sugar instead of dark only because I didn't have these ingredients. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the filling because mine turned our too runny. After I made the cookies into sandwiches I put them in the fridge to firm up the filling since the tops were starting to slide a bit. I also recommend baking the cookies on parchment lined baking sheets. My cookies were too soft to let cool on wire racks so I let them cool and firm on the cookie sheet and then moved then to the wire racks.",
