I increased the sugar to 1 cup (it seemed too tart with 3/4 cup but I'm sure tartness varies depending on the ripeness of the cranberries). I also added 1/2 tsp of orange zest. I used a 2qt saucepan and ended up not having enough room for all of the apple (granny smiths) and pear pieces. It was great with the amount used. Next time I will only use one apple and one pear. This will be a standard Turkey Day Dish in our house from now on! Excellent recipe - thanks for sharing it!!",
