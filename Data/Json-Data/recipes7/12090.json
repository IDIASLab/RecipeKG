I have admit I thought it a little ironic to use eggs in a recipe calling for a No Yolks product. It was easy to make and tasted rich and creamy. I don't think the corn flakes added anything to the taste of this recipe though and I wouldn't add them next time. I would however top with a chocolate sauce to serve.",

Nothing was burnt or hard on top although I wish the corn flakes were a little more crispy? Not sure if it's because I bought a store-brand corn flake or what but I kind of wished for a little more crunch. The sweetness throughout the dish was good - not overly sweet like many desserts and the raisins helped give it another element of sweetness that punched it up a bit. In the future I would add some cinnamon (and maybe vanilla) to the custard mix. For never having had kugel before I didn't think it was bad but could definitely stand to be experimented with for a stronger flavor.",
