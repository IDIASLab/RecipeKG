I used more tahini than originally called for (about 1/4 cup instead of 1 tbsp) because I had trouble getting the paste to spread far enough on the bottom of the dish and I only used about half the syrup in the end. The dessert was deliciously nutty and had a nice moist slightly grainy texture without being too sticky.",

I made it out of one and a half cups sugar one cup water one teaspoon lemon juice one teaspoon rose water and a tiny touch of orange peel (I got this from another recipe because I knew I would like less sugar and I did not have orange flower water on hand). I had to boil the simple syrup a bit longer than stated in order to get it syrupy enough. Maybe the orange flower water would have added a different taste but I still wouldn't be able to eat it because the sweetness level made me feel a little sick. As a matter of fact I couldn't get anyone to eat it. Also I greased my foil extremely well but had the hardest time getting it to unstick both from the pan and the cake. The one positive was that the pieces were very attractive and the texture was good.Thanks for letting me try out a new recipe (and using up my farina and yogurt)!",
