Even though I have good luck with rolled crusts, I tried the one in the recipe and was pleasantly surprised. For the 12\" pie I one and a half times the crust ingredients and doubled the filling which was exactly the right proportions.  I used unsweetened almond milk which is what I had on hand and was thrilled at how unnoticable this change made to the taste of the pie (and really decreased the number of calories per serving--an added bonus).\nI too would have had to cook this pie longer than stated even in a regular sized pan.  In my supersized pan (microwave safe) I cooked the pie for 6 minutes on high in the microwave--which is a great trick for lessening overall cooking time of pies if your pan is microwave safe.  I then cooked pie in oven @ 425\u00b0 for 15 minutes and 350\u00b0 for an hour.  Simply a perfect pumpkin pie.--Johanna",

We are trying to omit as much dairy as possible and I needed to use up some pumpkin that I froze last Fall.  I made my own crust, but I am excited to try this version.  Working with pre-frozen pumpkin, I thought I'd need to make up for the extra water so I decreased the milk to only 1 cup.  For the rest of the filling, based on comments that it came out a little less \"set\" than the traditional recipe, I omitted the oil.  I also halved the cinnamon per reviewer comments.    And the kicker...I added a heaping tablespoon of cashew cream (raw, soaked, rinsed, the purreed with water) hoping it would give the recipe the 'fat' that was missing from the diary.  It baked at 425 for 20 mins, then 350 for 1 hour.  The result?  A perfectly set, firm pumpkin pie.  It is absolutely unnoticeable that it is any different from traditional pumpkin pie.  Thanks again 'BakesCakes.'",

The crust would not come together for me and did not make enough to fit my pie dish. Overall I'm somewhat disappointed in this recipe. I might try it again with a bigger dish and a different crust recipe.",
