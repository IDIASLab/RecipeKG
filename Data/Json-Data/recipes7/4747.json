The only changes I made were out of necessity: I couldn't find orange cake mix so I substituted lemon and orangecello for the triple sec because that's what I had on hand. It came out of the oven tender moist and golden. Oh and I also \"dusted\" my bundt pan with granulated sugar so my cake even had a pretty \"salt rim!!\" The glaze as written is very tart (and alcoholic!) but I like sour things and when paired with the cake it tasted fine. I would recommend tasting the glaze before you put it on the cake and adjust with added water and/or sugar to your tastes.",
