I as usual could not stick to the recipe and modified it by halving the recipe putting it in a pie crust adding lemon juice to the apples using more pomegranate (as suggested in a previous review) and dotting the top with caramel quarters. I was really surprised as it was not 'seedy' as I had expected and the chewy bits of caramel were quite nice! This dessert was a big hit!",
