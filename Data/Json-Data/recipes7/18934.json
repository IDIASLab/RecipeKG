It's easily made vegan (if you use margarine instead of butter or 2 tablespoons of olive oil), ready in 30 minutes, and I give leftovers to my kids for lunch. If you like, you can add cream, but my family likes it the way it is. I usually serve it with rosemary bread for dunking.",

I used basil..I love the taste of tomatoes and basil..plus to make it rich in protein I threw in a can of white bean.. they have no flavor so it didn't interrupt the great taste of the soup...

I smashed some garlic, fresh basil and parsely. and a pinch of salt and pepper  and a tiny drizzle  of olive oil.  For a REALLY rich flavor, I slathered the tops of the tomatoes with a really good tomato paste , not too heavy but enough to cover. I roasted at 350 degrees for about an hour.  Then I assembled my soup as directed (I went very light on the oregano) making sure to use ALL of the squeezings as well.  People who do not like tomato soup love this soup.  Great for freezing AND over pasta.  Best though is with a Grilled Cheese Sandwich. Oh, and I make it using plant butter rather than traditional butter.",
