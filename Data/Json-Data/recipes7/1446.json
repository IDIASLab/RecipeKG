First, I used tenderloins instead of wings, because that\u2019s what I had on hand.  I also omitted the sesame oil (allergies) and used Tabasco\u00ae Garlic Pepper Sauce (that\u2019s probably not the same sauce used in the recipe).  I reduced the sauce before I put it on the chicken. I put the chicken in a foil-lined pan, covered it with the sauce, and baked for 25 minutes.  It turned out very juicy and delightful.  An excellent recipe!",

I decided to change the preparation mainly because I think marinating provides a deeper flavor. I started with almost 3 pounds of wings(tips removed) and placed them in zip-lock bag. I mixed the sauce ingredients in the amounts stated (plenty) and mixed into the wings. Refrigerated overnite. Preheat oven to 425. Cover shallow baking pan with foil and coat with cooking spray. Drain marinade and pat wings dry. Arrange on baking sheets and place in hot oven for 20-25 min. turning half-way through. I then basted wings with 1/2 C. (or as needed)bottled BBQ sauce with 1-2 T. of chili-garlic sauce mixed in. Back into oven for 5 min or until brown and gooey. They were delicious and clean-up was effortless!",

I really wanted to try this but only had chicken tenders so used that instead of wing. I marinated them for about 4-5 hours; then took out of the marinate and coated lightly in flour and fried them up. Super good and so easy. We love General Tso; its nice and crispy so wanted to get the same effect. My husband could not stop saying how much he liked the taste and flavor that were in these. Served with homemade shrimp fried rice. Great combo. Thanks",
