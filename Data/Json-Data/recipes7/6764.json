I am picky when it comes to cakes and this one is worth the time and the wait for the 2 days to enjoy it. The only changes I made was to use a 12 oz can of cocont milk instead of the evaporated milk, poured the milk sauce on when warm, and put on the whip cream after it was refrigerated for 2 days. and topped it with toasted coconut.

Next time, I would omit the almond flavoring or reduce it to maybe a quarter teaspoon, it's just not to my taste (to much like Christmas cut out cookies). I would also cut back the sugar a little, maybe by 1/4 cup. don't worry about the liquid being too much it Will all be absorbed by the cake, in fact, it's probably more absorbed then some other tres leches cakes that I've had. the cake will be high and fluffy out of the oven, I ended up baking mine for 37 minutes the top was golden and a few cracks just starting in the middle. The cake will shrink and flatten out (becoming denser) as it cools, I ran a knife around the edges to loosen right away. Letting the cake cool will allow it to continue cooking in case the middle has any slightly gooey parts. All in all it got a thumbs up and with the changes should be a 5 star for me.",

It had hundreds of reviews, but for some reason, at the last minute, I had second thoughts and decided to look around and settled on making this one instead, even though it had only a handful of reviews. I'm SO glad I did! This cake was fabulous!! I'd never made it before, so I was a bit nervous to bring it to a work potluck, but everyone who tried it loved it. I made only two minor revisions - I used vanilla extract instead of almond (daughter has an almond allergy) and used powdered sugar in the whipping cream just because that's what I always use. Followed the directions otherwise exactly as written. Success! Looking at how the measurement of ingredients differs in this one so much from the one I was going to try, I can't even imagine how the other one could work out.",

I can see this as is being so lovely on a hot day straight out of the fridge. I'm in IL in the fall however so I jazzed it up!! In the batter I halved the almond extract and added a full tsp of vanilla. I grated some fresh nutmeg (probably about 1/2tsp) and added some cinnamon (probably about 1/4tsp) and a shot of Rumchata. I also added another shot of Rumchata to the whipped cream and probably only used about half the sugar figuring the liquor likely adds some sweet too. And dusted the top w another bit of fresh nutmeg and cinnamon. Made it for a coworkers birthday who loves tres leches. He was SO happy! Resounding success. Thank you so much for sharing. This cake has so many possibilities. I'm going to have to make it again and again to satisfy my curiosity. Is anyone is looking for a good gift I'm going to need a gym membership! Lol. Happy baking y'all!",

This had me worried, so I poured out a considerable amount of liquid out of the pan (1/4 of the total) before icing the cake with whipped cream and refrigerating it. It turned out dense, moist, very sweet, but very nice complexity of vanilla and other flavors. (I also replaced the almond extract with vanilla.) It's worth noting that my eggs never stiffened even after I beat them a long time, and it still turned out alright.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great recipe. It may seem like a lot of liquid, but it gets absorbed into the cake very quickly. We didn't wait for the cake to cool before we poured the milk mixture on top, and it turned out beautifully. I was a little concerned because the cake rose up really high while it was cooking, but once I removed it from the oven and poked the holes into it, it fell enough so that the topping could be added. The cake turned out very moist and flavorful, but not as wet as other tres leches cakes I've had. The texture was wonderful. \n\nYou can top it with toasted sliced almonds and fresh strawberries to make it extra special. It's the perfect dessert for summer and definitely better served the next day. My husband also tried it topped with coconut and with sliced bananas, and that was good too. You can really customize it to your own tastes. I like that you can bake it in a standard 13x9 inch pan. Other recipes I looked at required pan sizes that we don't have. Will definitely make this one again. Might try substituting vanilla extract for the almond next time, although the almond pairs great with fresh strawberries.",
