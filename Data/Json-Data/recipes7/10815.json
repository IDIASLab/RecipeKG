After reading lutzflcat review, I omitted all the water while the flavors blended.  In the evening when I mixed the dressing I still liked the consistency, so I did not add the water.  I made a half batch, and it was enough for four salads.  I love how you can taste the fresh Parmesan cheese in the dressing.  Thank you Patricia K, for sharing your recipe.  We eat a lot of salads in the summer, so I know I will be using this one again.",

I didn't have egg substitute and so just left it out. I did add some lemon zest to my dressing tho. Thanks for the recipe, it was wonderful and I will be using it again!",
