I followed the directions mostly except I used cake flour, didn't have a full cup of butter, I used a bit less and I used the zest and juice of one large lemon. I did 12 cupcakes and one 8\" square pan for roughly 33 mins, they turned out flawless. They are dense yet light all at the same time. This could be enjoyed without an icing or frosting, but I made a whipped vanilla pudding with lemon topping and ate with fresh blueberries. Would make for an amazing trifle with any sort of berry. Secondly, this is a great base cake, in the fact I think you could keep out anything lemonly and use vanilla or almond extract to make a different flavored cake...which I will try sometime in the near future! Thank you for posting this recipe! I use to frequent a now closed cupcake shop that had cupcakes at this denseness and moisture, and I've been trying to recreate them ever since.",

It baked to a beautiful golden color and when cut, revealed a  moist and tender crumb. On the basis of these characteristics I was prepared to write a 5-star review - until I tasted it.  I have just one criticism, but in my view it's a biggie.  The cake just isn't sweet enough. A powdered sugar glaze helped, but it didn't make up for the insufficient amount of sugar, which affected not only the sweetness factor of course, but the flavor factor as well.  The cake could use at least another 1/2 cup of sugar, and even another full cup wouldn't be too much.",
