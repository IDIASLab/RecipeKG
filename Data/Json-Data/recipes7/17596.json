They're dense on the inside -- the better to hold the fillings -- but if you prefer a more tender, croissant-type texture, decrease the masa, increase the bread flour, and omit the gluten. I've also included lard in the dough, but feel free to use all butter. These don't keep well, so plan to eat them all on the day you make them.",
