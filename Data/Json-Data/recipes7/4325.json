I did reduce the amount of cinnamon from 2 T to 2 tsp after reading other reviews on this recipe and it was perfect! Next I want to try and add a can of mandarin oranges possibly trying in some crepes for our Friendsgiving brunch. It was liquidy when I finished the 45 minutes on the stove top which scared me but it gelled perfectly after refrigeration. I was actually requested to make this again for next Thanksgiving. Def 5 Stars!",
