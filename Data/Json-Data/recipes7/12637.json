Only thing...I couldn't bring myself to add a tablespoon of coconut extract (I use pure coconut extract) so I did reduce that amount to 1/4 teaspoon and that was absolutely perfect. As a lover of both coconut and cheesecake I knew I was gonna love these. Oh also I did have to leave these in the oven a bit longer so just keep an eye on that. These were so simple to make and the flavors are wonderful. I will be making these over and over YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing.:)",
