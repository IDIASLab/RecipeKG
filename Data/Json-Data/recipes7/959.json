To those whose cakes didn't rise: perhaps your butter and eggs weren't at room temperature. Also after having beaten in half the eggs adding a spoonful of the flour before beating in the rest of the eggs can help stabilize the batter. This technique seems to work well in cakes that don't have chemical leavening agents.",
