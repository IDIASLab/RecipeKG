There are a few helpful hints and \"know hows\" that might give you more of an idea on how and what to do. Making mints is really a science! No really! First and foremost (my very strong suggestion it can be done without it but I wouldn't attempt it!) Is get yourself a smoothed/polished marble slab or granite (marble is better it can be less pouruos)wash and butter it (with real butter!) and get it in the freezer or outside if it's freezing (you know snow) In the winter time I store mine outside in a large garbage bag always at the ready;) You will use this. The reason why she tells you to cover the pot so that sugar crystals will get washed down is because if there is just ONE grain of undesolved sugar it has the potential to turn All the rest of the batch to sugar and keep it from becoming the heavenly little candy that it is. A suggestion here (and what I always do) is take a clean good bristle baster next to your pan put your bastor in about 2 cups of warm water and as your mixture is boiling take the bastor and baste down the sides of the pan with the water rinsing the bastor (in your warm water) frequently paying attention that you see no sugar crystals anywhere on the sides. Once that's done and you are sure there's no sugar on the sides leave it alone! No more stirring! Don't fuss with it! Let it reach t",

I think the secret seems to be to not start working it too soon. let it sit till it really is cool enough to handle. Doing the smaller batch was a great deal easier and the results are so worth it.
