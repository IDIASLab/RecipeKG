I did toss my blueberries in some flour before adding to the batter which always helps in getting them evenly distributed instead of all dropping to the bottom of the loaf.  Followed this recipe to the letter, and it was very moist and tender with juicy bites of blueberries.  Very nice, thanks for sharing your recipe STILLSWEET43.  ****3.9.16   Family coming for a visit this weekend, so I baked this recipe into muffins.  Made BIG muffins (got 12) and baked for 23 minutes @ 350.  Just as delicious as the banana bread loaf I first made.  Have one breakfast out of the way now   :-) ****UPDATE 5.9.18:   I had 3 smallish very ripe bananas that were either going to be used today or heading out with the trash tomorrow.  Used all 3, and decided to try to lighten this recipe (although nutritionally it\u2019s really not bad the way it\u2019s written), so sub\u2019d Truvia Baking Blend for the sugar, Egg Beaters for eggs, margarine for the butter, and sprinkled some organic coconut sugar on the top before baking.  They don\u2019t look as nice as others I\u2019ve made using this recipe, but they still tasted awesome.  So I guess that means I can eat two, instead of one???",

                "reviewBody": "I only made a couple of changes to this recipe.  The first one was because of necessity.  I doubled the batch and ran out of butter and had to substitute canola oil.  The second change was due to taste.  After the whole process, I tasted the batter, and wanted more blueberry, so I added an additional cup, making the total 3 c. for the double batch (btw, all I had were frozen blueberries, so that\u2019s what I used \u2013 which accounts for the blue/purple color of my loaves).  The only other change was that I made regular size loaves instead of mini ones.  The batter tasted so good I could have eaten it all raw, and would have too, if it weren\u2019t for the 4 raw eggs in there (well, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have eaten it ALL, but I would have certainly eaten my share!)  Because I made regular size loaves, it took about 20 extra minutes to bake, making the total bake time 45 minutes.  They came out looking luscious golden brown, with the delicious crispy/chewy crust I love, moist in the middle, and just yummy  through and through!  When I woke up the day after making it, my family had devoured one whole loaf, and were all raving about how great it was.",

Melt-in-your-mouth divine..... I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten free baking flour, and it turned out beautifully. I used two 8\"x 3+7/8\" aluminum baking pans (store bought) so I can take these to a social gathering. Obviously one won't make it there ;)  Worked out perfectly!  Baked both together for about 50-55 minutes. (Rotated pans  halfway through so they would bake evenly).  Followed the recipe as written, although did sub 3/4 c. brown sugar for the white sugar.  Did not need additional rising agent. I did add a topping: mixed 5 TBSP. brown sugar, 2 TBSP. flour, 1/8 tsp. cinnamon together, then cut in 1 TBSP. butter until crumbly. Sprinkled over the top and baked.  Next time I may add cinnamon to the batter.  Would also prefer more blueberries, but this was yummy! Thanks for sharing the recipe, Stillsweet43!",
