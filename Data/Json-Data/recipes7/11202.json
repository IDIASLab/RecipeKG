I did add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the crust to balance the sweet & salty flavor. A full table spoon of honey is not needed on the baked crust.  By doubling the recipe I still did not fill my entire pizza tray - I would triple if making it for a big crowd. No one had tried a fruit pizza quite like this before, it was a big hit at the Super Bowl Party!",
