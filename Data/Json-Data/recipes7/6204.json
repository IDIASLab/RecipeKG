You may want to use a bigger saucepan, I think its easier to mix in. A whisk would beat a spoon by far (no pun intended). If this dish isn't rich enough for you, you could try using chocolate milk, but any milk is fine: skim, 1%, 2%, whole, even soy milk. Same thing with the chocolate; use whatever suits your taste buds: dark, semisweet, or milk chocolate.",

I use 60% cacao chips from Ghiradelli and Hersheys unsweetened cocoa powder. I also use real vanilla extract. not the cheap imitation kind, it makes a big difference. Sometimes i also like to mix in some brown sugar with the white. So please consider this when making the pudding. Thanks.",

The flavor was 5 star made exactly as written with the optional cocoa powder and I added salt(always add salt to chocolate recipes! It really enhances the flavor!) but the ingredient proportions were way off for me. It was basically just chocolate pudding(a tasty one I'll give it that) but there was not many tapioca \"pearls\" in it. Not what I thought it was going to be. This was my first time making quick-cooking tapioca so maybe I'm just not used to that but when I try this recipe again I'll either decrease the milk drastically or add at least a tablespoon or 2 more tapioca. Or I may just soak larger tapioca pearls then try this recipe. Thanks for the recipe!:) EDIT: I soaked 2 tablespoons of the quick-cooking tapioca in some water heated it up drained it well and added it to the pudding I made. It was much better! I still want to try this with some regular tapioca I'm sure it would be beyond words!",
