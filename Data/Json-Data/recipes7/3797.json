My husband works around a lot of Vietnamese restaurants, and I was making him bring me home these tasty sandwiches. Finally I attempted to make one, and found that my recipe was even better than the restaurants, mainly because I used chicken breast and fresher ingredients. I also love the pickled vegetables, so I made sure there was plenty of those.",

Adding additional ingredients could make this a much better a more solid Banh Mi. One key ingredient that was not mentioned here is the soy sauce which is typically added atop the mayo and for those feeling a bit more adventurous, duck/chicken pate. As far as meat goes, the most popular/common filling is the cha siu (xa xiu) pork which is a sweet BBQ pork that is grilled/fried (my personal favorite as it goes well with the pickled veggies). Chicken can be used as well, Vietnamese  cold cuts, pork meatballs or even firm fried tofu for a vegetarian option.",

I'd had pork to use from a slow smoked butt roast which was moist & wonderfully seasoned so I think any good flavored pork or chicken might work just as well. I let the veggies marinate 1 hour & they were great - lots of flavor but still fresh & crunchy! I lightly toasted just the crusts of my bagette, & I used all the veg & garnish suggested but added a dash of soy sauce over all because the mayo just didn't do enough, so I'll hafta figure that out next. But try it - it's a great sandwich!",

I tried adding garlic powder and a little Chinese 5 spice just to see.  We loved it.  Next we're gonna try the Asian BBQ Pork from Costco as a sandwich filler.",

So I can't attest to whether or not it is authentic but I will say I followed this recipe pretty closely and it was delicious and very fresh. The only changes I made were I used a whole grain hoagie roll instead of a French baguette and I mixed in Sriracha with my mayonnaise. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it and we plan on making more meat tomorrow to eat with the left over veggies I prepared. I'm letting the slaw marinate overnight as well and expect it to be even more fantastic tomorrow. Definitely would recommend trying.",
