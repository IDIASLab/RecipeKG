Before tossing the apples with the filling ingredients I tossed them in a little lemon juice and I used two tablespoons cornstarch instead of tapioca. I also added 2 tablespoons melted butter to the filling only to make more of a \"filling\" when it was combined with the juices of the apples during the baking process. Really REALLY good. Jazz apples were on sale this week and a GREAT apple in this particular recipe. Crisp and slightly tart with a light sweetness. The smell of this while it was baking was ah-mazing! The one issue I had with this filling is it came out a little dry. When I try this again (and I will try this again) I'd make more of a juicier bottom by making a kind of apple pie filling out of either apple juice and water and the remaining ingredients. It could have been because my ingredients would not fit in a pie pan but I've really not had this happen before. The flavor was good and the sweetness was perfect--it just needs more \"stuff\" in the actual apple-y part. NOTE: My ingredients were too......much for a 9 inch pie pan. This fit into a 9x13 baking dish just right. 30 minutes at 350 degrees was just right for me.",

I also did not measure the apples and instead just sliced up 4 empire apples. I doubled the oats to make up for the coconut. And I also added 2 tablespoons of melted butter to the apple filling because we like more of a pie type filling. As I said this was excellent. Next time I will use at least one more apple as I feel it was a little skimpy in the apple department. And I for sure want to try this with coconut! I used a 9x13 casserole dish for this because I was concerned it would be too much for a 9 inch pie plate. I made homemade whipped cream and served this as a dessert for Thanksgiving. It got many compliments and was definitely a favorite. I'll be filing this one away.",
