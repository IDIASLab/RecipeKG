I used pickling salt prepared horseradish sauce and sweet chilli sauce (1/4 cup each) and omitted the added sugar salt vinegar radish and red peppers. I minced crystallized ginger fresh scallions and fresh garlic. The instruction to wrap the outer leaf around the cabbage section did not make any sense to me the leaf being much too small. I sprinkled the mixture liberally between the leaves fanning them like playing cards rolled each section and stuffed them in pint jars 2 per jar. Then I turned the jars over twice per day to move the liquid around. Has just enough sweet heat for me! For the salt soak to hold the cabbage down in the brine a ceramic plate works with a heavy mug or bottle on top. You will see it sink into the liquid as the cabbage wilts.",
