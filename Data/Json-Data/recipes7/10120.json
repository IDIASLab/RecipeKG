The first was that I added an extra 1/4 cup of maple syrup to the brown sugar/margarine mixture to ensure there was enough to coat the top after it was assembled (didn't want \"dry tops\" like the first reviewer). \n\nThe other change is that I used thick cut bacon (8 slices) and \"candied\" it first by pressing dark brown sugar liberally onto both sides and sprinkling it with cayenne pepper (this is also referred to as Billionaire's Bacon). Lay it on a cookie sheet lined with foil and bake it in the over at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. Allow it to cool on parchment and then chop it up into pieces. Overall, it was the perfect combination of smoky, salty and sweet (with just a TOUCH of heat). While all of it was good, the inside pieces were gooey and delicious. We will definitely make this again!",

I did remove it from a nonstick bundt pan at 20 minutes it was too hot to work with any earlier. I needed to bake it another 8 minutes to bake all the bread through. I used butter since I don't use margarine at all added a teaspoon of madagascar bourbon vanilla & chopped pecans along with the bacon crumbles. It took me longer than expected to prep. Next time I may forego adding the left over cinnamon sugar to the maple sauce since it came out very sweet and already has an incredible amount of sugar in it.",
