I followed the recipe completely - except for adding a teaspoon of cinnamon. It slid out of the baking dish like a flan - and even looked like a flan to our amazement. Next time, I'll add butter and vanilla extract to the caramel to give it a bit more creaminess. Outside of that, I wouldn't change a thing.

I used 3 day old dry Italian loaf on the first one and it soaked up the egg mixture very well and was a very moist and flavorful result. The 2nd one was not as old and crustier and didn't soak up the egg as well giving a drier result. Both times I had more then half the egg mixture left over so the next time I make this and I will make it again I am going to cut the measurements on the egg mixture. So very good!",
