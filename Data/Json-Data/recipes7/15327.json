OMG... really awesome! I learned a few things while making this. 4 pears is too many for a 9\" tart. I ended up poaching 3 and only ended up using about 2-1/2 of them (they were delicious so I just ate the leftovers). There is too much of the frangipane filling as well. I used all of it and when I placed the pears on top the pears sunk into the filling (hence not the beautiful presentation that I was hoping for) and while it was baking the filling went over the edges and onto the baking sheet (good call on having a baking sheet under the tart pan)! I also didn't use blanched almonds. I just ground them up in my food processor which I'd do again. The flavor is wonderful though so I'd definitely make this one again. Oh and that poaching liquid - I strained that and have been using it to sweeten a cup of tea. It's just lovely!",
