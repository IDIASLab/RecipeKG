My local grocery store doesn't carry sweet potato patties so I bought sweet potato tater tots. I used 2 and rolled the dough up. They have that rich dessert flavor great for the fall weather.",

Each can of crescent rolls contains 8 crescent rolls, so 2 tubes equals 16 rolls. Put a full sweet potato pattie in each crescent roll. You also need to bake this about 15-20 minutes longer than this recipe says. The top of the rolls baked like crescent rolls, the bottom stays kind of doughy because it\u2019s immersed in the liquid -it\u2019s supposed to be this way (just an FYI). These are superbly delicious. Easy to make. Definitely a special occasion dish for me, and I think it has already been voted into our regular Thanksgiving rotation.",
