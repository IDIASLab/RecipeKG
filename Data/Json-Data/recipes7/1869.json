They were very soft and moist I was just expecting a firmer outside. Mine did not turn out like the picture. The blueberry mixture that is added to the wet ingredients turned my scones blue. Again if just rated on taste these would get 5 stars. My kids (2 4 5 9) loved them. I made them for a tea party thinking that if they were purple it would be okay but they were an odd blue green color.",

I tried to make drop biscuit-type scones, but they spread our like thick cookies and ran together.  They do have an odd color.  The flavor was bland, but scones are bland.  I topped them with an almond glaze and sprinkled them with almonds, so they are not too bad.  I'm calling them \"Mermaid Tea Cakes\" since I will be taking them to the beach.  If I cut my square-ish tea cakes on the diagonal, they might pass as somewhat like a scone.",
