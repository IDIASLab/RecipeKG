I substituted the sugar and used brown sugar, and only used half the sugar (substituted stevia--the kind used for baking--for the other half). I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It turned out delicious!\n\nThe amount of corn starch assures that this will be a very firm set pudding--moreso the next day. I'm not sure if the dairy milk helped make it set more? In any case, it was fine. I tried the recipe a second time, with one-third dairy milk, two-thirds almond milk. Same with the sugar combination (one third sugar, two-thirds stevia). The pudding turned out great!\n\nThis will be one of my go-to recipes for chocolate pudding. I can vary the percentages of stevia (and sugar), as well as vary the  percentages of almond milk/dairy milk and it seems like it will turn out fine every time!",

I see that it calls for 3 cups of milk, so am I safe in assuming that it'll make about 4, considering the other ingredients??? \nI just want to know how much it yields, so I know how kuch I want to make on my first go-round, because I ABHOR waste.\nIf anyone knows, please let me know...
