Took the advice of several other reviewers and added about a tsp of garlic powder to the dough. Dough was a little sticky and I did add about an additional 1/2 of flour overall to keep it manageable. Also greased pan with olive oil and then sprinkled some cornmeal to keep it from sticking and poked holes in dough. Changed butter spread to 1/2 olive oil 1/2 butter 1/2 tsp oregano and a clove of garlic and spread on the dough. Then from BATMAN BEYOND's review of Parmesian Foccacia Bread (a bread machine recipe) which suggested chopping a fresh tomato - I used two small ones and some fresh basil as well - and saute in just a little olive oil with some fresh garlic salt. Then sprinkled the tomato mixture over the butter/olive oil spread on the dough. Lastly sprinkle on the parmesian cheese and bake. I used the same temp but it took about 10 minutes longer to bake and set up in the middle. So good! This was gone in absolutely no time and my kids beg me everyday to make it...",

Someone mentioned that this dough should be a \"wet\" dough and sticky and not to add more flour.  That advice was perfect.  I just made sure I had enough flour to roll with and on my hands so it wasn't to hard to work with.  \nThe first time I made it I put in 2 cloves of crushed garlic in the dough while kneeding it instead of using the powder and it wasn't enough. It was still a nice flat bread.  The 2nd time I added 4 cloves and used about 1tbs of garlic powder and it was more flavorful  I also left the cheese off until it was about a minute from being done and I brushed it with butter and then put on the cheese and cooked one minute and took it out of oven and let it melt while it rested.  I liked it much better that way, then what the original recipe calls for.  ",

Other than that I followed the recipe. These were very good! I cut them into strips to serve like breadsticks and had marinara for dipping. We'll have these again for sure!!",

In reading the reviews, alot of people noted that the dough was sticky and that they added in extra flour, perhaps they are not aware, but this type of dough is considered a \"Batter yeast dough\" - this means it will be sticky, and you should NOT add any extra flour, except for perhaps a small sprinkling of flour for the area in which you end up kneading the dough. I don't even bother to knead it. I let mine proof in a glass bowl, once it has risen I invert the bowl onto a parchment lined baking sheet and lift the bowl away. \nInstead of plain butter, I used a butter that already had garlic & herbs mixed into it, and then I used fresh grated parmesan, and a 6 italian cheese blend plus additional mozzarella cheese.  I also added some garlic powder and italian seasoning into the yeast dough.  This is\ncomparable to a focaccia I normally buy at a local delicatessen.",

I added minced garlic to the dough at the very end and dried oregano after putting on the cheeses. My daughter is gobbling it up. The workability of this recipe however!!!! I threw the ingredients into the bread machine on the pizza dough cycle and when it was done I had a bowl of soup. I needed to add a good cup of flour to make it even remotely workable and it was still sticky. I also had to scrape the thick layer of residue off my kitchen table. Also there was way too much butter. Maybe 1/3 cup is necessary if you work with some spreadable ingredient like margarine but with melted butter I ended throwing out half of it. While the finished product is soft and delicious I greatly did not appreciate the inaccurate list of measurements.",
