I followed the recipe exactly but left the pan on medium uncovered, rather than bumping to high, for longer than the extra 1-2 min., to ensure nice brown spots and nothing dried out, but to also allow me to finish preparing the rest of dinner. Something about the plumpy raisins and squishy tomato bites really worked w/ this, and a squirt of fresh lemon juice put this over the top. Yum delight indeed.",
