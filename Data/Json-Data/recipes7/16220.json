I really like what I came up with mainly because it's not super complicated and there aren't any other competing flavors with the pears. The other ingredients are delicate and allow the pears to stand out. With all that being said, please note that these measurements are approximations... Enjoy!",

                "reviewBody": "These were tasty! If I could, I might give a 1/2 star more just for the flavor, but they were dense and did not rise, and felt more like soft energy bites versus muffins. It's hard to bake with almond flour and have it rise like wheat flour, so there may need to be more baking soda, or even baking powder (which contains baking soda already). If the mixture were less wet, I would say add an additional *cold* egg for leavening power (the cold egg white portion of the egg would create steam and help with a rise), but not sure how this would work with the almond flour included in the recipe. Also, this made 24 muffins versus 12 muffins. With the second batch, I let the muffins cook an additional 3-4 minutes but other than a bit more browning and color, everything tasted the same. Thanks for sharing!",
