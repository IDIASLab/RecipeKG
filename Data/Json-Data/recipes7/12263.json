I microwaved it to get it spoon-able but was not particularly happy with the consistency. Also the cream cheese mixture was not thin enough to drizzle and I had to add milk to get it to a drizzling consistency. We also had quite of bit of both the cinnamon mixture and the cream cheese mixture leftover after having generously spooned it over all six of the bigger sized waffles we got from the batter. Overall a nice treat for a special breakfast. We served our with bacon. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",
