My boyfriend and I found the recipe on a coupon or something at the store last summer and immediately bought all the ingredients and made it that night.  It is the best!  We make it several times per year.  We always used to order peanut butter pie for dessert at restaurants, but don't do it anymore because this recipe is just so much better, not to mention cheaper.  I like to use Neufchatel cheese and drizzle the pie crust with the fudge first.  French Vanilla Cool Whip is a yummy substitution as well.  Edited 5/26/10 to add: we've made this many times over the past few years.  My fiance actually proposed to me while we ate this pie together!  I know it's just a fluffy recipe with convenience food ingredients, but it will always be special to us.",

It's super rich so cut small pieces. I was only able to eat two bites it was really over the top. NOTE: I used reduced fat cream cheese and \"free\" topping and you totally can't tell.;)",

I also used Smucker's special recipe dark chocolate topping instead of hot fudge because it has less fat. I had a 1/16th slice and had trouble finishing it which is too rich for me. I adore peanut butter but I think that is part of the problem. Next time I would use less peanut butter and more whipped topping to lighten it. Perhaps also a bit more chocolate on top.",
