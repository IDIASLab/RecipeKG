I wanted to have something that would be ready for everyone to sit and eat together. I couldn't find one, so I began experimenting. Finally, I am satisfied with this one. All of my tasters agreed it worked. Top it with butter, syrup, or your favorite topping.",

Today I doubled the sausage as considered by bookwormans below. Definitely not to much. Thanks for the advice.\n10,26,19.\nToday I was goofing off and tried a muffin tin.\n NICE. \nEvery one had a nice crusty edge. Easy to handle. Dips in syrup or whatever great. 40 yr old tin so brushed with oil. Be sure to preheat pan just a bit.",
