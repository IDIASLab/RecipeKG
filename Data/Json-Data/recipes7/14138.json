Fabulously moist cake with wonderful chocolate frosting (has a Ganache like flavor). My 14 year old son loved it. The dry ice/marshmallow cream/water mixture is sooooo much fun!!! It oozed out and smoked forever. I paired this cake with the sparkler candles and it was super entertaining. I was able to purchase the dry ice from publix and we used less than 1 pound. I cut the top off of a water bottle and used it as the funnel. I cooled the marshmallow cream mixture for a few minutes before pouring it in the bottle. This would be a great volcano for school--it spewed way longer than our Diet Coke/mento combo. This was an epic birthday cake!!!!",
