Made a pourable version to top Marty Fries' Tiramisu Cheesecake on this site. SUGGESTIONS/SUBSTITUTIONS: To make this recipe pourable test the temp of the chocolate mixture with a (clean) finger. When it feels neither hot nor cold to the touch fold in the whipped cream - instead of waiting until it's room temperature. Also because I didn't have any rum/wine on hand I used chocolate liqueur instead. Chef John is an amazing teacher - entertaining AND thorough.",
