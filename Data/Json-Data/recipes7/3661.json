I'm a little confused by the directions abou thte batter being too runny...mine were very thick like muffin batter not like pancakes--maybe bc of the thickness of my ranch dressing? I forged ahead any way and made pancakes by spreading it out in the pan with my fingers. These are really sweet--you don't taste the ranch or bbq sauce much at all. Bf thought they were the consistency of funnel cake but was not impressed at all. I thought they were just too sweet and I didn't put any powdered sugar on these. I thought they were interesting and wanted to try; maybe I will make those funnel cakes instead next time by using sour cream and some other sauce instead of the bbq. Thanks for the recipe!",
