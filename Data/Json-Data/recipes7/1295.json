It uses three types of liquor--you do not need the best brands,  but do not buy the cheapest either. Note that raw eggs are 'cooked' by the alcohol. Once made, keep the eggnog refrigerated and use within a week, stirring gently before serving to re-incorporate the egg whites that rise to the surface.",

But I never recorded the recipe and over the years drifted too far away from the base recipe to where it became average. So this year I searched for a recipe that would bring me back and THIS IS IT! Betty's Eggnog is as good if not better than mine ever was. Absolutely fantastic!...if you think liquor is what defines a good Eggnog...which I do. I used her recipe but was a little more selective with the liquor: 1 bottle of American Honey 1/2 bottle of Meyers dark rum and VSOP brandy. I also added an extra pint of heavy cream and a quart of half and half. PERFECT! Thank you Betty for bringing me back home to the perfect eggnog! Good for breakfast lunch dinner and all thirsty periods in between...",
