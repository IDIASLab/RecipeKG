We live in a very rural community without the luxury of large supermarkets or health food stores.   We have to be very careful with reading ingredients and substituting in recipes.  Finding \"treat\" recipes for him that acutally taste good and don't have a weird texture has not been easy.  So until I tried these, he had never had a doughnut.  And these are terrific.  Even his cousins who usually turn their noses at \"Parker proof\" treats, loved these sprinkled with a little powdered sugar.  The second time I made them, we added a little cinnamon to the batter and they are like a banana bread donut.  I plan on trying other fruits like applesauce and pumpkin in the future.  Thank you so very much for sharing.",

I added a third banana in the second batch, and cut the water down a little bit.   I didn't have any problem with them coming out raw. I followed the directions and made sure that the oil was approximately 350 degrees (I used a candy thermometer), and dropped the batter in by slightly less than 1/4 cup fulls. I cooked the first side for 3 minutes, turned them over, and cooked for 2 more minutes (I used a timer.)   Some of the panikekes wanted to turn themselves over prematurely, so I had to hold them under the oil with tongs.  I sprinkled these with confectioners sugar, and they came out perfect! They are also fun to make!",

I used a large frying pan and filled it about half way...that was plenty...just flip them over when they appeared to be golden. I sprinkled mine with cinnamon sugar when they came out mmm TIP: don't cover them up until they have completely cooled! Otherwise they just become soggy.",

On the second try I used maybe a little more than 1/8 cup and it was perfect. And I did make sure the oil was exactly 350 degrees with my candy/deep fryer thermometer.
