Just had some of this fresh out of the oven at the time of typing this... it tastes really good when it's hot! And the recipe is adaptable too I had to omit the coconut and walnuts due to a lack of said ingredients and had to substitute regular milk for the buttermilk for the same reason but it still turned out amazing. Will definitely make again.",

Made Apple sauce from 3 apples no one was going to eat, and was just a little short on buttermilk, so I added about 1 ounce of sour cream as well. Cooked for 40 minutes and came out super moist and just a little sticky on top, like coffee cake should! Finger and fork lickin\u2019 good! It was sweet enough without powdered sugar, but we did top with a little whipped cream instead.",
