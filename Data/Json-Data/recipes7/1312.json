I might've over mixed the mixture a little but it still had a moderately chunky texture. I layered it with whipped cream in champagne glasses finishing with a huge dollop of whipped cream. I would've liked it a little more if I had made a \"crumble\" base and put that as the first layer in the glass just to give it a little different texture and taste. All in all I would make this again!",

A good old-fashioned combination of that fleeting jewel of a fruit and sweetened whipped cream.
