                "reviewBody": "I will start by saying this was delicious and I will absolutely make it again! This time I followed the recipe very closely. The biggest change is that not having an immersion blender I boiled all the roasted veggies with everything else for a few minutes and put in some good effort with a normal potato masher. To add a touch of creaminess I added about 5 tbsp of neufchatel cheese. The end result was creamy soup with small chunks of roasted veggies rather than a fully blended soup. Which was awesome. My only critique is that it was a little too sweet. Next time I will halve or possibly skip the apple cider in favor of relying on the actual apples for a more subtle flavor. I served it with herb stuffing roasted in the hollows of the squash added at the 20 minute mark and honey butter crescent rolls.",
