We used strawberry rhubarb preserves, and did not add the vegetable oil to the peanut butter.  If it's heated, it becomes easy enough to drizzle without the oil. Thanks for a fun, great recipe! *Here's a tip to get them to look like my photo--Instead of using my thumb to make the indentation, I use a 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon measuring spoon.  Press it in the center, and you'll get a perfect spot to place your jam or jelly.",

If anyone has any suggestions on how to get them to turn out like the pic - please let me know! I used Strawberry Preserves instead of Grape Jelly. And I heated up a couple tablespoonfuls of PB in a plastic baggie (placed in a mug) and every 10 seconds I took out the PB in baggie and mixed by massaging the bag of PB. Then once it was softened I cut a VERY small hole in the corner and squeezed (for drizzle) the PB on each cookie - turned out really well! And no veg. oil was needed. I would also recomend making them smaller using smaller balls of cookie dough to begin with maybe 1\" verses the recomended 1.5\". Overall - YUMMY! I WILL make again!",
