You can substitute the strawberries for peaches or raspberries or blackberries or blueberries or a mixture of any of these and change to the appropriate gelatin depending on what is in season.  You can even use canned fruit (think mandarin oranges or pineapple).  If you need it sugar free for a diabetic, splenda works very well, as does sugar free gelatin, but be careful measuring it because there is less of it (takes about half a package for one pie).  I have even made it once with chopped cranberries sweetened with splenda in place of the berries and a bit of grated orange peel in the cheesecake part for a Thanksgiving or Christmas dessert...  Splenda can make it sugar free quite well!  It's very versatile and no one ever believes it is so easy to make.  Use a graham cracker crust if you MUST, but a real deep dish pie crust is best!  YUMMY!!!",

I am concerned though as there is so much of the cream cheese mixture that the pie crust without any berries is already full! I will barely get one thin layer of berry slices on top and then I am worried that the glaze mixture will run off the edges! This must be for a very deep pie crust not a pre-made frozen Tenderflake.",

The only change I made was that I used a graham cracker crust instead of a regular pie crust.  Cheesecake always needs a graham cracker crust!  I was unsure about how the strawberry glaze was going to be but it was fine!  I will make this again, and soon!  One important discovery, now that I have made this several times.  I couldn't figure out why the cheesecake filling was coming out lumpy.  I figured out that you have to beat the softened cream cheese (I softened it on low in the microwave) and the sugar together FIRST before you add the lemon juice and the eggs.  Otherwise you get lumpy bits of cream cheese  in your filling, instead of it being a nice, smooth, creamy filling.",

It was not a hit...in fact he didnt even finish his piece....  The one thing positive I can say about this cheesecake is it looked scrumptous!  The cheesecake itself had a weird texture and was bland...it just wasn't creamy enough.  We definitely prefer graham cracker crusts and the Jell-o on top was a little too much...everyonce and a while you'd get some that was all jello and no strawberry and it wasn't pleasant.    All in all a Valentine's Day flop!",
