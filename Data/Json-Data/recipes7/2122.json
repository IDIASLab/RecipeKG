I was very leery of making it as I have tried several from this site to no avail. We don't keep cream of wheat in the house normally as my kids wont eat it, so I made a special trip to the grocery just for it and OMG was it so worth it. I have never even thought about writing a review until now I want to get on the top of the highest point and shout it to everyone \"OMG you have to try these\" I followed it exactly as written, but doubled it(wanted way more then 5) well it made 8 cake cakes and I still have a whole bowl full in the fridge, this is the first time I have ever save the batter usually just toss it but I am thinking that it would be a mortal sin to toss this batter...lol... I did top it with my own syrup that I will be posting on this site Strawberry banana yummyyyyy...thank you so very much for sharing this with the world....",

I was looking for a way to use up a big box of Malt-O-Meal (DS wanted it and then decided he didn't like it) and came across this recipe.  I have made this recipe several times.  I usually double it each time I make it.  I've made with the sour cream and have also substituted plain yogurt and vanilla yogurt that I needed to use up.  Cook on the electric griddle at 350\u00b0.  These pancakes are wonderful and they freeze great for a quick breakfast.  My family just microwaves for 30 seconds, flips them over and 15 seconds more. We've even toasted them in the toaster with great results.  Thanks CSYJNAMOM for sharing this recipe.  I've shared it a few times with friends.",

I substituted whole wheat flour, decreased the white sugar to about 1/8 cup of brown sugar, I didn't have sour cream so instead I soured the 1 1/4 cup milk with lemon juice, and mashed up a ripe banana and substituted that for the 1/2 cup sour cream.  They rose increadibly well and turned out light and fluffy.  I'll definitely be making these again, thank you for the great recipe! :)",
