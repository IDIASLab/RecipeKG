If you can\u2019t do real eggs make sure to add 1/2 more coconut milk & soak overnight... soaking overnight must be important. *also I added cinnamon & garam masala. Flavor was great with all the coconut yumminess & extra spices, & toasty on the outside was quite good; had it not been for the odd gelatinous pockets cooking for 40 minutes. I will definitely try this again but with real eggs.",
