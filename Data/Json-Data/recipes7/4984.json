Instead of adding the garlic and sesame oil at later stages in the recipe, I mixed both with the sauce.  I diced the onion instead of slicing so everything would be the same shape.  I used Lee Kum Kee Garlic Chili Sauce.  It's really chunky and more of a paste than a sauce.  I don't find it that spicy so I added red pepper flakes to the sauce to boost up the heat.  I stir fried the eggplant in two batches using a 14\" carbon steel wok, and added about 6 fresh basil leaves to the last batch.  I returned the eggplant and onion back to the wok and then stirred in the sauce and let it cook for a minute or so.  I kept stirring as it cooked to keep it from burning.    I will make this again as it is a tasty and quick recipe for eggplant.",

In China I use spicey black bean sauce, and in the U.S. the Thai paste.  Depends on what I have availiable.  I'm not sure why it would ever be too liquid, as I more often have to add extra water rather than thicken it.  I love this recepie and it is a staple in our household.  Fast easy & healthy.

This will become a go-to after work dinner or weekend lunch.  Thank you!",

I added about 1 teaspoon of grated ginger, and about 8 oz. of edamame to the mix too. I also replaced the chili sauce with chile paste and a squirt of sriracha... turned out delish! :)",

I suggest cooking everything together for much longer, almost 15 minutes, so the eggplant gets really creamy and absorbs all the sauce.  Great, easy, fast recipe!
