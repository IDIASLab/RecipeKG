I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used 1/2 cup of Hellman's light mayo cut with 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream for added creaminess along with the curry, paprika and cayenne pepper.  I also added a little bit of salt and black pepper. It chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good. Overall, a great combination of flavors! Especially good on whole grain bread!",

Maybe I had an extra large chicken but the mayonnaise wasn't near enough to cover the pieces (and I don't like things mayonnaisey at all so I was looking for a very light coating not a heavy dressing). Even after adding extra mayo the salad felt like it was missing something. I added in a little honey and a tbsp of chopped pecans and that made it better but I don't think I'll be making this recipe again. There are some other excellent chicken curry salad recipes available on this site so I will go back to those next time.",

I didn't have a rotisserie so I used 2 really large cooked chicken breasts. I followed all of the ingredients except the apple I did peel because the recipe didn't specify and I used lite mayonaise with olive oil. I am sure the full fat mayo would taste excellent. I served it on some whole wheat bread I made today. It is a little more spicy then what I am used to from my normal chicken salad but it was nice to try something different.",
