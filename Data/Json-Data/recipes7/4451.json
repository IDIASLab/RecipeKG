It came easily out of the pan after being loosened just a bit. I couldn't really taste a significant amount of coffee flavor so I glazed it with an orange glaze so that even if there was a hint of coffee it would still blend well with the kick of orange. I then topped it with hazelnuts.:) It looks lovely. Thanks for the recipe!",
