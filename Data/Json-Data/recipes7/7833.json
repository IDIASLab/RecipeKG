It is very important to use fresh udon noodles. If you use packaged dry noodles, they will get very soggy and the texture ruins the dish.  I like to crack the eggs into the boiling broth and stir it a bit, then there are no big yolk balls.  In Hawaii, we eat nabeyaki udon with a bowl of hot rice. Yum yum!",

I only used 1 package of tofu which was enough for me and I used half a package of dried shitakes which I soaked in water to reconstitute and then sliced them up.",
