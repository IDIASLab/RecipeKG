I did end up using a little more mozzerella than the recipe asked for--my husband requested more cheese. Even with my substitutions, the recipe turned out fabulous and the family loved it! Good recipe. NOTE: For those of you who use a jarred sauce, be sure you taste your sauce before you add in the whole three tablespoons of white sugar. It might be a little too sweet for some.",
