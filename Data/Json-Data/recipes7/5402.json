And I couldn't quite get the batter to get smooth like I was worried about. I was hoping for a more creamier texture with the cheese like danishes at coffee shops or bakeries. The texture though was just odd to me. I also had thought about just pinching 2 of the sides so the apples would show but there was too much cheese filling on each one to do that. The first batch I didn't sprinkle enough sugar on and I then realized that 3 Tblsp. came out to be 1/2 tsp. of sugar on top of each one. The ones with the right amount tasted best. I also think homemade puff pastry would be much more flakier and less greasy but it is also a very time-consuming so I understand the usage of the frozen. This is not a repeat recipe because of the cheese taste and texture not being to my liking but it was interesting to try either way.",

Next time I'll use only about 12 ounces of Greek yogurt which should be perfect. I also added a little more sugar and a little more vanilla. Also I sprinkle a little sugar cinnamon and vanilla one the apples which made them a little sweeter since I use Granny Smith. Will definitely do this recipe again the kids loved it",
