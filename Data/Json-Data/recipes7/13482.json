The vinegar was way too strong. I made the recipe as written then made a lot of tweaks to get it the right taste for our family. My recommendations: Cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup and increase the pomegranate juice to 1-1/2 cups. (I reduced 2 cups pomegranate juice on the stove to about 1 cup reduction in a subsequent attempt at this recipe and liked it even better so you may play with the pomegranate juice.) I increased the shallot garlic and pepper and used about 2 tsp. salt. I've also tried replacing the sugar with honey and find I like that better as well. Thanks for the recipe Mel. It's a good starter base for a good dressing.",
