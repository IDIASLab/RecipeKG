I decided to try it out today and will be making 12 dozen of these two weeks from now after all. My toddler is fully enjoying this cookie with a small glass of milk. Having just made the cookies today I find the crunchy edges and inner chewiness delightfully seasonal and a nice change from other run-of-the-mill cookie exchange fare. I wonder if any will last until tomorrow to see if the texture or taste improves from what impressed me today. The only thing I did different from the recipe was to use vegetable oil. Oh I also lightly sprayed the pans and only halfway rolled the cookies in sugar trying to prevent any from sticking to the pan in case that was going to happen otherwise.",
