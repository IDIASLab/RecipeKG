You can change the type of vinegar (try balsamic rice wine or other vinegars) for a different flavor. Sometimes I add a little lemon juice as well. You can also change the herbs and spices. Dried dill is very good and if you've got fresh herbs they can be minced and thrown in.",

I look forward to trying it with cider vinegar. I liked it this way and my guests claimed the proportions were good. WARNING: If you plan to have leftovers to refrigerate I recommend using something other than olive oil which solidifies in the fridge. When I plan to use it again I just have to take it out in plenty of time to melt.",
