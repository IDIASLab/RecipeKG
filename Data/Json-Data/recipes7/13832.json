I didn't end up adding as much of the sauce at the end but rather went by taste. Also I accidently cooked my noodles in the hot water step longer than 3 min so this would probably account for less sauce being needed. Overall great taste! I will make this again for sure.",

I will make this again, next time with bean sprouts, which I like in my Pad Thai.  Thanks for the recipe!",
