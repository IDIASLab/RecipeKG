Then add the hot milk, a drop of vanilla, top with marshmallows and enjoy!  I also add a pinch of salt to bring out the flavor. ",

At first i was skeptical because chili powder isnt something you normally pair with chocolate but it gives it a strangely attractive flavor. I substituted 2c milk with vanilla \"Silk\" (soymilk) and it still turned out delicious. be sure to stir very well before drinking and keep a spoon handy while drinking because everything settles. otherwise this is one of the very best mugs of chocolate i've ever had.",

In an attempt to salvage - I doubled the cocoa powder and sugar and it was slightly better. Then I added a couple sprinkles salt again a little better but not worthwhile. Then I added about 1/4 heavy cream. An improvement but not good. Then ended up adding 4 squares of Lindt Dark Chili chocolate bar. With the changes I would give it a 2 or 3. Definitely won't make this again. I recommend trying a smaller version before you go with the whole recipe. The grainy texture from the spices was not pleasant either. I'll keep looking.",

I'll be making this by the cup so followed the suggestion to mix the dry ingredients (except sugar). I then put a rounded 1/2 T of the mix in a mug with a bit of vanilla and then enough boiling water to make a paste. I then added my almond milk slowly to blend and put the mug in the microwave for about 1 1/2 min. I added one packet of Truvia but may be able to use less next time.
