I found this recipe interesting but unbalanced in its flavors. While edible for me I think there was too much ginger and the ground cloves \"took over\" the cottage cheese. I do not feel compelled to make this again. My wife did not care for this. I rate this two stars because this is not a recipe I would use UNLESS I was serving people with very tolerant and esoteric tastes. Cardamon if you don't have it is quite expensive. Now I am left wondering what else to do with it. On the plus side it was original and it did look good on the plate. But this should be targeted towards a very particular audience.",

Changes to the recipe include 1/2 tsp. of powdered ginger instead of 1 Tbs of minced fresh ginger and less spinach. Due to my inability to handle anything with capsaicin I also skipped the green peppers. Overall I call it a success with its ethnic twist on boring 'ol cottage cheese and unique use of flavors.",
