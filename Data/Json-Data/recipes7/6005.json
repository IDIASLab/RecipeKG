I ended up with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 4 Tablespoons sugar.  And DH is eating them straight from the fridge!  I said that again. . . Thank you Bobi",

I did increase the sugar too, thought it might balance it out, but in the end I had to throw this away. I'm disappointed people rate recipes highly and then comment that they made huge changes to the recipe, that rating is deceptive! I trust the star ratings to believe a recipe will be good.
