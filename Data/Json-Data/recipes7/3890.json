I had more cubed steak than listed so put the spices directly on the meat. Then the flour/saltine combination. Then egg/milk. Then flour/saltine again. I had plenty of the coating. Didn't make extra. Everyone liked it but it didn't wow me. The coating I'll definately make again - adding spices to it or to both it & the meat. (Four ounces saltines is a sleeve btw - provided you have a pound box). Allowing the meat to lose its coolness helped the breading adhere to the steak & not stick to the pan (I think anyway). I cooked them over (gas) medium for about 5 minutes on each side. Once (& sorry if it grosses you out) the wet pinkish color starts to come to the top of the steak it's time to turn over. Using half butter & half olive oil is a yum combination for panfrying. Oh made white gravy too. Good idea.",
