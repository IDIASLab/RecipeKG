I used a standard square brownie pan and it came out fine. My local grocery store didn't seem to have Golden Syrup so I used light corn syrup and it worked fine. I also I used Nestle milk chocolate morsels for the chocolate and that was fine also. I let the base of the bars cool thoroughly but it still took a long time for the chocolate to get really firm. The next time I make these I think I will add a lot of shredded coconut. This recipe is easy to make and fun to eat.",
