I prepped both the filling and the topping the day before and left in the frig until I was ready to assemble/bake before dinner. I wanted individual portions so I used ramekins w/no issue. I baked for about 30-35 minutes and served w/a scoop of ice cream. I used Granny Smith apples per personal preference. I can definately see this getting made again at the LTH house. THANKS for the recipe Ashley Tex!",
