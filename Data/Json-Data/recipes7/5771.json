I based my decision mostly on the fact that the cake contained pudding so I knew it wouldn't be dry. The cake was just ok. I only had 1 ounce of red food coloring but the cake was plenty red. I probably should have added 1 ounce of water to replace the missing food coloring but I didn't think about it until it was too late. The batter was very thick and when cooked the layers were pretty flat. The icing was not to my liking. My kids thought the buttercream tasted funny and in general the cake lacked flavor. I will not be making this cake again:(",

I must say I was plesantly surprised! this is absolutely the best recipe for red velvet cake I have ever tried. As a testiment to this cake I made it and wrapped a large slice for my husband who drives trucks for a living. he said the cake was so good that he licked the aluminum foil it was wrapped in! very funny when he told it to me. The only thing i did different was I used cream cheese frosing instead of the buttercream.",

Used only 1 oz food coloring. As a sub for buttermilk I used 1 cup regular milk mixed w/ 1 tablespoon white vinegar (usually you would use 1 T vinegar w/ enough milk to make a cup but with cutting out some food coloring I did it this way). I also used nearly 3 tablespoons cocoa. Since I was baking in dark non-stick pans I reduced oven temp to 340 and they were perfect in 27 minutes. For frosting I stuck with a cream cheese - 8 oz reduced fat cream cheese 1/2 cup softened butter 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1-3/4 cups confect. sugar - it was perfect - not too sweet! Even with all my subs this is a real hit!",
