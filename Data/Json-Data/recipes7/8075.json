I put the wet ingredients together and then poured it in the chute slowly on pulse until it started to stick together. I did add a couple more tablespoons of milk. Dump the dough out on a floured surface and mix gently with hands until it sticks together and pat into a circle about an inch thick. I cut in 12 wedges and spaced them apart on a pan sprayed with Pam. These were great. Don't skip the fresh lemon rind and fresh lemon juice. Served with fresh strawberries and black grapes. Great compliment with the lemon.",

The scones' density is perfect -- not too dense, not too airy -- and they were perfectly moist!  A hit with all of us from age 6 up!  Some of us would prefer even more lemon flavor, but no glaze, so next time I'll forego the glaze and add more zest and/or juice or extract to the batter.  However, it was DELISH! with the glaze we made. We did make a change to the glaze -- used just a cup or so of powdered sugar, mixed in lemon extract + lemon juice, and just a smidgen of water [no butter, no vanilla].  We like it lemony & tart!  Drizzled it over the cooled scones & our glaze hardened nicely.  It added a perfect lemony YUM to the scone! And it didn't make too much.  This is a great scone recipe!  Will try the recipe again, too, replacing all things lemon with all things orange for orange scones.  This base recipe is so great, I'm sure those will be amazing, too!",

I'd like a bit more intensity in the lemon flavor in the scones and frosting.\n\nEither halve the frosting recipe or double the batch of scones! There was more than enough to slather on every bite and we still had leftover frosting.  We ran out of scones way too soon.\n\nWe can't eat a lot of real sugar. Made the scones with splenda and they came out fine.  The real sugar frosting was too sweet for us.  Next time I'll try a sweetened lemon butter with zest in it instead of frosting; or a lemon-flavored cream cheese frosting. We can use splenda since sugar isn't the main ingredient. \n\nAll Recipes Cranberry Scones By Anne DeCosta has a great butter recipe that should adapt to lemon zest and splenda.\n\nEven though we can't eat the sugar, as is, Angelstar's Amazing Lemon Scones recipe is 5 star.  This would be lovely for Christmas breakfast or for a ladies tea.  Then by all means make all the frosting and serve the extra \"on the side.\"",
