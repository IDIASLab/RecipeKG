Not only does this taste divine it also breaks down pretty well nutritionally. Another nice thing about it is if made the night before it's one of those \"grab & go\" breakfasts on your way to work. It was completely cooked at 45 minutes so do watch your time. It was so good that I could eat this for dessert. This one's a keeper!",

After baking I let it cool completely before slicing it and storing it in a container in the fridge. It is a quick bite to grab in the morning or any time I'm craving a snack. It keeps well in the fridge and can be eaten cold or warmed. Two modifications to the mix that make this even more enjoyable are to add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and to substitute 2 teaspoons of loose brown sugar for the pinch of white sugar.",

I use a 9x13 glass pan and double all of the ingredients (left out the baking powder because it didn't seem to make a difference) added 1/2 cup milled flax seed, about 1 tbsp cinnamon, two egg whites, 2 tsp vanilla, and 3 Tbsp brown sugar substitute (ex: Splenda). Bake for 1 hour 15 mins, cool in pan, cut into 10 bars, wrap bars individually.  pop in microwave for about 35 seconds for a grab and go breakfast.  try using different combinations of dried fruits and spices such as cardamom and pears or apricots with cloves and nutmeg.",
