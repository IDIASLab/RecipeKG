My boyfriend loves to tweak this recipe. However, I just love this simple basic recipe and I hope you do, too. It's better if you can marinate this overnight. I put it in gallon sealable bag and keep in refrigerator then pour in pan the next day.",

After laying them out on a foil lined baking sheet I poured the extra marinade over them. I baked them approx 25 mins per side. They cooked through perfectly. I served these to a group of 15 teenagers and got rave reviews. They came back for more! Always a good sign. Thanks for sharing.",
