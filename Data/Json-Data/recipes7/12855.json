I accidentally forgot to add the milk so it was thicker than the recipe intended but still delicious. My method was a little different than the recipe. I cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise and scooped out the seeds then placed it cut side down on a jelly roll pan with 1/4 inch or so of water and baked at 375 until soft. I let it cool a little then scooped it out and proceeded as instructed. My peas and cheese were frozen so the whole mixture was cold and rather than standing and stirring it on the stove I put it in a covered casserole dish and put it in the hot oven for 20 minutes or so until everything was hot and the cheese melted. My girls ages 3 almost 5 and 7 couldn't get done raving about it.",
