I creamed the oil, sugar, and eggs then added the other ingredients leaving the flour for last. My 14 year old daughter actually made this. We decorated it with the traditional giglio from Florence. It was a hit at Easter, but we'll make it again for no special occasion-we liked it that much. Next time, we'll substitute the orange for lemon. Thank you for the recipe.",
