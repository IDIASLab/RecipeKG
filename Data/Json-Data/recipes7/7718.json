I dropped two of them in the pot and turned around -- they were black. The dough is so thin that you'll want to cook these one at a time. Tastewise, these are delicious. A nice, quick weekday dessert. You could even do the apples ahead of time.",

Next time I think as I am rolling and flattening the biscuits I will sprinkle with a little cinnamon sugar mix. They cook quick or I had my oil too hot. Anyhow they turned out fantastic and my kids cannot wait until the next time. What made it really great is that the apples just came from the tree within a few hours. Yum. Thanks Mary",
