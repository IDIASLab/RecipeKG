I halved the recipe and used: whole wheat flour instead of regular organic cane sugar instead of white sugar Extra virgin olive oil instead of veggie shortening and soy milk instead of regular milk I ommited the pecans because they were not available at the time. I also put the cakes in two buttered aluminum loave pans since I did not have any bundt pans. I was expecting a catastrophe since when I was mixing the butters and sugars the olive oil floated a bit on top but in the end I got this beautiful delicious pound cake like dessert drizzled with tasty caramel sauce. The sauce was so good I see myself making it to coincide with some apples! This recipe is so easy and can be very great for events like garnishing with strawberries or bananas and leaving a bowl of caramel glaze in the middle yum yum!",

I let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turned it over onto a cake dish before I added the glaze.  Other than that, it was fantastic, thanks!",

Someone mentioned it growing over the sides of the bundt pan, and since detest cleaning my oven, I made a bundt pan AND 3 muffins!  This was the perfect amount in the 12 cup pan.  Rose right up to the top without spilling over.  TIP WITH THE SAUCE!!!  Boil for 4 minutes.  If using the bundt pan, cool and flip the cake onto a plate.  Pour 1/4 of the hot sauce on the cake and let the liquid seep in.  Let the remaining sauce cool for 15 or 20 minutes until it thickens and then pour the remaining over the cake so it stays where you put it. :)",

I baked it in a bundt cake pan and it rose above the rim of the pan. It also took 1 hr and 35min in my oven to finish baking. I allowed the cake to cool for the 10 min in the pan then turned it out onto a cooling rack. Then I used a spoon to slowly drizzle the glaze over the entire cake. It turned out very nice and pretty. Very moist! Make sure to allow to cool completely before covering.",

                "reviewBody": "Very tasty cake indeed! There was way too much batter for my bundt pan so I transferred the rest to a medium-sized loaf pan. The cooking time was much longer than specified and so I ended up turning the heat up to 350 to get it done a little faster. But I think 325 in the beginning was a good start. Only think I left out was the pecans as many people I serve cake do not like nuts although I think it needs them. And I left off the glaze and used my own brown sugar caramel glaze/frosting. I actually followed a mixing technique from 'The Cake Bible'. She actually mixes the dry ingredients in the bowl on low for 30 seconds rather than just relying on sifting and then adds in the butter and part of the wet ingredients all at once. What this does is to help provide a 'coating' for the wheat and prevents the gluten strands from forming too quickly and getting too tough. This keeps a cake fluffy and soft and moist without getting too tough or dry. It works out beautifully. I would agree with others this cake isn't exactly a pound cake in texture but it's a lovely cake either way. Thanks!",
