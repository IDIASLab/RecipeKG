I learned it while I was in the Peace Corps; it quickly became my favorite dish! The authentic West African preparation requires squishing this by hand until the mixture is fairly uniform - a food processor also works. Serve over medium-grained rice. Okra sauce (folere) is a traditional accompaniment.",

The tomato and squash provide naturally sweet undertones while the garlic onion and bay leaf infuse the sauce with a savory flavor. I was intrigued by this recipe and thankfully all 10 of us enjoyed it =) Not to tamper with the \"traditional flavor... but I enjoyed this with hot sauce and imagine that a minced jalapeno sauteed with the onions or perhaps some red pepper flakes could add a lot to this dish. Oh and some chopped cilantro would be excellent too. Thanks for sharing Anne-Marie!",

I was unsure about how much the 2\" cube should have been cooked anyway. I didn't have natural peanut butter and I used regular peanut butter. That could have made it a little on the sweet side. I combined the garlic salt and peanut butter sauce all together. I think I liked it more than my boyfriend did. Thanx for posting this interesting/unique recipe!",
