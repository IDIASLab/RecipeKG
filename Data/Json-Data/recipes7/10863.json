An extra sprinkle of cinnamon and Splenda before microwaving made a sweet crunch on top. This gives you around 250 calories, so you could add juice or a smoothy as well. There's also lots of for room to experiment with other spices and mix in's. I liked the addition of fresh fruit, but nuts, chips, or dried fruits with other spice combos would work too. Just a cup and spoon to wash when you are done!",

This recipe does that with a few easy-to-remember ingredients that cook up just fine in the microwave. The cinnamon is perfect for me, but if I were to fix this again, I would add a little more sugar. Like another reviewer, I stirred the bread into the liquid. Seems as though it would set better if all cubes were slightly moist. Most mug recipes are for eating quickly or on-the-go, but this morning I wanted to treat myself, so I turned my French toast cup out onto a pretty tea and toast set and slowly enjoyed my breakfast.",

I made just as stated, but I stirred the bread around instead of just pressing it into the egg mixture; wanted to make sure it all got coated. It took 90 seconds exactly in my microwave. I poured some real maple syrup on top, and it tasted somewhat like french toast. I'll make it again sometime. *update- I've made this a few times now, and I leave out the butter and just use cooking spray in the mug, and I leave out the sugar. Comes out perfect. So quick, just pour some syrup on top and eat it straight from the mug.",

I added some walnuts and chocolate chips between the two ripped up slices of bread and I think the added crunch from the nuts helped a lot. I doubled the sugar and actually dumped it out of the cup onto a plate to eat...doing that I found the egg was still quite runny at the bottom, so I microwaved it on the plate for another 30 seconds. All in all, a nice easy way to have french toast without too much hassle!",
