I was worried it would leak out as it was heaped up pretty high but I put some turkey stuffing inside around the edges in the hopes it would help prevent leaks. Can t say for sure if it worked but it turned out leak-free and beautiful. I added an additional 1/2 cup gravy according to reviewers. Also I don t think it needed as much extra seasoning maybe half the amount would have been perfect.",
