I followed the recipe the first time and it took way too long to rise. I did NOT use a bread machine. If making by hand, just throw all the ingredients into one bowl and mix. No need to proof the yeast, it will still rise (make sure yeast is fresh). I've kneaded this both by hand and using a dough hook for a good 5 min. This dough comes together well and is not sticky, so kneading by hand is a cinch. Instead of using extra flour when kneading, which can toughen and dry the finished product, spray your hands with PAM or oil and knead that way.  No sticking and no extra flour needed.  I let this rise in a warm oven until doubled, then rise a 2nd time in a (9x5) loaf pan.  Baked at 350 for 20 min. Brush with butter when it comes out and cover loosely with foil to soften the outer crust. Great crumb and texture. I will make again.\nTIP - I use 2 cups white flour and the rest wheat flour.  As a general rule, I always add one tablespoon powdered gluten for every cup of wheat flour I use in any recipe. This keeps the bread nice and chewy.",

I put the ingredients in the bread machine set to dough cycle, after it finished I put the bread into a 9 by 5 load pan, let rise for 30 minutes, and then baked in the oven (350 degrees) for 27 minutes, I had the timer set at 30 but pulled it out a few minutes early, it probably could have baked the entire 30 minutes and turned out fine.  It almost has a sourdough taste to it but it is very soft and light.  I love it and so does the family! Can't wait to make some sandwiches with it.  Just for clarification I used reduced-fat cultured buttermilk that comes in a little jug like regular milk.  Thanks for this great recipe! ",

I thought it was short on salt and yeast so I increased both without straying from the recipe too much - 1 tsp. salt and two tsp. yeast. I kept the measurements of all else the same but used bread flour for the all-purpose flour by accident (it's called making assumptions and not reading the recipe carefully - again). In any case this is all you'd want in a basic everyday bread. It rose baked and sliced nicely and has great flavor (I DO think it needed that extra salt). I'm not a big fan of whole wheat bread much preferring white bread so this was perfect for me with its mere 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour. So if you're thinking this is a hearty whole wheat bread choose a different recipe - or use this one with half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose (or bread flour). No matter how you slice it (ha!) this is a great bread one of the better ones I've tried from this site.",

I will make this again when I have extra buttermilk however my personal preference would be that this recipe needs a little more salt. I usually make breads with more whole wheat flour but I think the ratio of white/wheat in this recipe makes for a really nice light texture. I made this using the bread maker dough setting then I rolled it out let it rise in a regular loaf pan and baked it at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes.",
