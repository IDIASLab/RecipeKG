I ran into a problem with the sugar, following the directions I waited for a few pieces to pop before adding it in and got splattered  by oil,  was actually stirring the sugar so it would melt enough that I could shake the pot and the sugar would be a sticky sugary paste the kernels just stuck to; again I ran into the problem of the oil splattering. To say the least my first batch burned on the bottom.  The second time I made it, I added the sugar and the kernels in at the same time and the popcorn turned out delicious.",

                "reviewBody": "Super easy followed as is it yields a good sized bowl of crispy crunchy and certainly sugary popcorn. On a scale of 100 I'd give this a 95 but that's still an A. Some recipe notes after trying this several times: Heating the oil slowly is a big deal. Before you put the kernels in drop a couple into the oil. Do they pop quickly? If so then your oil is too hot. Reduce the heat and wait about 15 seconds then try again. If you guessed wrong and they start going off the moment they hit the oil then you'll have to pour the sugar immediately. This will still result in a random mix of over and under coated kernels. Ideally if you bring up the heat slowly waiting until the kernels pop works. IMHO best way: - Bring oil to low heat. - When test kernel sizzles but doesn't immediately pop add kernels and reserve half of your brown sugar/sugar mix. I also add a little coarse salt. Distribute evenly and stir if necessary. - Add lid and gradually increase heat while gently agitating the mixture. - When first kernels pop add remaining sugar mix and replace lid. - DO NOT REMOVE THE LID - As the popping increases begin agitating the mix more fervently so the oil/sugar mixture coats all those freshly popped kernels. - The popping dies down. If you've ever popped stove top you know when it's done. - Pull it off the heat and shake it like hell. - Pour into bowls drizzle of you wish. Serve AFTER its cooled down. It'll seem kind of gooey at first but they crisp after they",
