                "reviewBody": "I have made these twice - the first time following the recipe exactly as written and directed and the second time making a few changes.  If you're looking for a very soft hamburger bun, closer to the kind you get at the store, these are good but as was reviewed by others, it will have a tough time holding together something juicy - as did mine the first time I baked and used for burgers.  They would make a great bun for a sandwich and the especially the kids would love this recipe as it's alot like store buns - which is one reason I didn't rate higher above average.  The reason I bake is because I don't want store bought taste, but if you like that, then these buns are great.  These would make an excellent dinner roll too.  The other reason for the average rating is the ingredient Vital Wheat Gluten.  This ingredient is not at all necessary in this recipe and is mainly used to lighten texture in whole grains or heavy wheat breads, so I left it out the second time around.  Instead, I added a beaten egg white (use a wire wisk, beat until foamy). It added a great texture.  I also used butter instead of the oil and slightly warmed milk instead of the water.  Made the buns richer in flavor.  Also, I used instant yeast and didn't have to pre activate the yeast, I just tossed it all in my kitchen aid, gave it a rise, shape and rise.. then baked at 400 degrees for 12 minutes in order to achieve better color.  BTW, using instant yeast gives a much nicer rise.  Posted a couple pics.",

While making the half recipe in the bread machine the dough sucked the paddle of the bottom, so I took the dough and and let it finish rising. I thought the dough seemed a little stiff. So I got scared and started another batch. I decided to try a full recipe but had to use mostly wheat flour.( I did add more gluten) The full recipe made about 7 rolls. I think you would only get 12 if you made dinner rolls/sliders. The funny thing is that both attempts came out fantastic!!! I thought I was going to have to freeze some... but nope.My 4 yr old ate 2 yesterday. I also made a sandwich for lunch yesterday with one and plan on doing that again today.I will be making these again and soon because they are almost gone!",

I should say though that when I make them I do not use the Vital Wheat Gluten.  I have always made them using white AP or Bread flour so do not find the VWG necessary.
