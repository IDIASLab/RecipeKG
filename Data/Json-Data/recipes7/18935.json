I will post a picture later and other peoples' opinions of the recipe. I happen to love cranberries and jalapenos and everything else that goes into making these pretty pinwheels. UPDATE: Just added photo. They are impressive.",

I also use more than the 1/4 cup of the cranberry mixture since it is so darn delicious... and there is still plenty left over to top turkey sandwiches!",
