One large lemon should be enough. Others say that it could be done in a microwave which is probably true but you would need to be very patient to stop and stir often to avoid having the mixture curdle. (I speak from experience having curdled a batch of custard before.) Over a double boiler you'll end up with perfect lemon curd without worrying about curdled eggs. I'll be using this lemon curd in the morning for my crepes. Can't wait.",

I will add the zest tomorrow since I don't have a lemon at the moment. It tastes awesome. It took considerably longer than 10 minutes before it thickened. The reason why some people never get it to thicken is because of their stove and the type of bowl they used. Many glass bowls take a lot longer to heat up than the metal does due to the thickness of most Pyrex mixing bowls. I ended up putting mine on 4 instead of 2(where it says simmer on the stove) and whisking it constantly. I ended up with not a single lump. It couldn't of came out better.",
