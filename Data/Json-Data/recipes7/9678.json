I try to follow the recipe as posted the first time around and would have done so this time, however, I accidentally put the milk in with the eggs and yogurt. Ooops. Of course it created a stickier dough so I had to add a bit of flour. But the result was moist, chewy delicious scones!",

I used baking powder (not soda), and next time will reduce to 3/4 tsp as the dough was plenty fluffy.  I also added 1/4 cup Craisins. Without all the butter, the texture is not as crumbly as a traditional scone, and mine really were quite dry after cooling.  Might have been the addition of the Craisins, so I will add a full cup of yogurt next time to improve the moisture content when using dried fruit. Worth tweaking, to arrive at a good lower calorie scone recipe.  Thanks to Paula for putting the recipe out here...I love scones, and I really want a good lower calorie version!",

I've never had a scone quite like it. They were SUPER chewy. I happen to like that in a carbohydrate but it might not be for everyone. I also noticed the vanilla flavor from the yogurt was really pronounced (I used Brown Cow cream-top yogurt). The only reason I wouldn't give five stars is that the dough was hard to work with and the texture was so unusual (but tasty!).",
