This gets gobbled up every time! No one ever guesses at the amount of veggies inside this firm but creamy yumminess! This great potluck pleaser freezes well. I used freshly chopped squash and zucchini as well as frozen chopped veggies (originally from my garden).",

I left out the added sugar, and I used a cornmeal mix that was not sweet, as we prefer cornbread to be savory.  This filled a 9\" x 13\" pan, and even bubbled over a bit, in the oven.",
