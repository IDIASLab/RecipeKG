Like others I found that the cookies will fall apart if you handle them while they're still hot. Rather than use a wire cooling rack I used a grill pan to cool them on. They fall through the wire rack. If you allow the full cooling time they hold together fine.",

They turned out phenomenal! I greased a cookie sheet with Pam (with olive oil flavor) and the cookies came right off the sheet when they were still warm. They were a little greasy because of this maybe but they didn't even last long enough to cool completely because my friends and family gobbled them up as soon as I put them on a plate! Great flavor and texture! Everyone of my friends loved them! THANKS!!!!",

I always make my drop cookies using an ice cream scoop for these I used my smallest one and was able to get 18 cookies on each sheet (since they do not spread much) for a total of 47. I baked them 16 minutes however they did not turn golden brown but were done. I left them on the cookie sheets until totally cooled actually about an hour as I was doing other things. They came off the cookie sheets easily with no problems and did not break apart but I think if handled roughly they would. For anyone that has eaten halvah the taste is very similar but I think these have a better texture.",

I added another 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 Tbsp Adams chunky peanut butter to the dough. These cookies were gone in two days! My kids loved them and I had them in the morning with coffee. The texture is perfect melt in your mouth like a peanut butter cookie should. (My 9 y/o said \"sandy\") Only four stars because I still would have liked them sweeter. Oh and I used parchment paper and let them cool before touching them they held together great. Try them!",
