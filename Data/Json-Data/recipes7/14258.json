There is either something missing or a step missing in this recipe. On my first attempt everything appeared normal but when I pulled it out of the freezer the fat was no longer incorporated in with the mixture but had rose to the top and the mixture below never set up. I tasted it and the flavor was good but it was like syrup. On my 2nd attempt and the last of my saved up bacon grease I let it go longer on the stove until it hit 250. This seemed to work pretty good however in getting there the red flakes burned along with some of the mixture. My house smelled horrid but since it was too hot to handle I stuck the whole mess in the freezer to make the smell go away. To my surprise the next morning it didn't look near as burnt as it had and the fat stayed incorporated with the rest that time. It was still too loose and not caramel-y though and the bacon grease flavor was too dominant. I really wanted this to work and I love the idea of the chili flakes but as written it simply did not work for me. Twice.",
