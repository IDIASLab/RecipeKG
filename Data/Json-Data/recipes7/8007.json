The yogurt really brings some moisture to the cake and the bits of pineapple definitely bring some flavor.

Next time I may add some coconut as suggested and maybe even add a few chopped pecans to the cake. IMO this is a solid coffee cake recipe and a keeper.",

I only put half of the pineapple (maybe that's why for some this cake wasn't heated evenly) and I put it in the oven for less time than specified (only 350) and for a longer time. You just have to play around with the time a bit since altitude and oven types vary. I also added a little cinnamon in this cake and it tasted pretty darn good! Loved the topping as well. This recipe really doesn't deserve only 3 stars. This will be my go to coffee cake recipe from now on!",

I didn't have pecans so I mixed coconut with the brown sugar for the topping. Came our nicely in 30 min at 375. The center was moist and cooked through almost the consistency of moist banana bread. I made a cream cheese pineapple glaze (1/4c butter-3oz cream cheese-1 and 1/2 c powered sugar and about 2 tbsp pineapple juice(enough to drizzle). I drizzled it over the top once it was cooled. I will definitely make this again and try using pineapple yogurt for an extra kick and also try less pineapple to see the difference it makes with the moistness.",
