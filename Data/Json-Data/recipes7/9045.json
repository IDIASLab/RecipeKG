I actually marinated it for 24 hours in the refrigerator and it turned out simply amazing. I will never try a different recipe for jerk chicken. This will be my \"go to\" every time now. I even forgot to add in the onion and it still turned out ridiculously good. I also used 6 jalapenos I stead of scotch bonnets, because the grocery store didn't have them and they didn't have habaneros either. I will use 10 jalapenos next time because I didn't taste any heat whatsoever. Thanks for sharing this outstanding jerk chicken recipe!",

I wore gloves and a mask when I was cleaning them as I did remove all the seeds and it was plenty hot for me. I hope to find the bonnet peppers the next time I make this.
