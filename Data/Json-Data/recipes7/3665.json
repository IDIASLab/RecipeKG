The lettuce would  be on the bottom, followed by a layer of celery, green onions (or bell pepper) followed by a layer of frozen peas (much tastier than canned peas), layer of your favorite dressing (mayo, miracle whip or you could do ranch or caesar), shredded cheddar and bacon bits..seven layers.  When you use the frozen peas, it helps keep everything below the peas stay fresher longer and it can be made ahead by even a day with no problem.  It was/is  always one of my favorite salads.",
