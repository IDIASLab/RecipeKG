Let the bread machine kneed the dough until a soft, smooth ball forms, 5-10 minutes. Then, turn bread machine off and place the dough into a bowl lightly covered with olive oil or cooking spray.  Put a damp towel over the bowl, and set the entire bowl in a warm place - such as an oven that has been \"warmed\" and shut off.  Let dough rise for 30 minutes, punch it down and then roll out r toss. Let rest for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to pan or stone, and bake.  Saves you almost 1.5 hours, including bake time!!!!!!",

I didn't have any beer since we don't drink and didn't feel like running to the liquor store with my 3 girls (all 4 years and younger).  So I decided to use a can of generic Cream Soda I had in the fridge.  I stirred it up for a while to remove the carbonation and threw it all in the machine as instructed (also added garlic powder and dried basil).  I followed advice of another reviewer and baked crust alone for about 5 minutes then added toppings and finished baking for about 15 additional minutes.  The crust's texture was excellent, the flavor was very good although I could taste the cream soda a little.  I will definitely make again but with beer next time!  Make this, you will love it!  (Oh and it makes one thick crust pizza the size of a normal round Pizza stone)",

I really love this recipe and will use it as our regular pizza night dough. I don't know what the best part of this dough is the fact that it is to silky soft but not sticky and really easy to work with or the perfect flavor and texture after baking! This made one big 16 by 14 cookie sheet sized pizza. After the 25 minutes baking I slid the pizza off the pan and directly onto the oven rack for a minute to crisp up the bottom because I used an insulated baking sheet -- great for cookies because it prevents the bottoms from burning but not ideal for pizza because you want the bottom crispy. Thank you so much for posting this recipe and thank you to Chikee for recommending it:)",

I didn't have a pizza stone or pan handy, so with a tip from my brother (the expert pizza guy) I preheated a heavy cookie sheet in the oven, and formed the pizza on parchment paper--then just slid the pizza on the parchment onto the hot cookie sheet.  Easy!  The crust overall was a little thicker than I like, I think next time I may split the dough in half and make two thinner crust pizzas, but that's just personal preference.",

My tips for making it a little crisper:  Brush the entire crust with a little olive oil before you add your toppings, then pre-bake for 5-6 minutes. Remove from oven, top as desired, and bake again until melty and yummy. If you're like me and LOVE a ton of fresh veggies on your pizza, try this to reduce the water that cooks out of them and makes your crust soggy:  Put mushrooms, peppers, onions, whatever you're using in a bowl and zap them for no more than a couple of minutes in the microwave, then let them rest, covered, for a bit.  They'll partially cook and you'll be amazed at the amount of liquid you can drain off BEFORE you add them to your yummy pizza crust! Enjoy!   ",
