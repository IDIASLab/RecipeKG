I like the idea but if I were to do something similar I would probably use more sugar and make a balsamic reduction rather than the way it is prepared in this recipe. The cake however was WONDERFUL on the grill. Did not take anywhere near 3 minutes on each side on a charcoal grill though so keep a close eye on it.",

I had a bottle of strawberry-balsamic glaze in the pantry so just decided to go with that.  I use black pepper occasionally  with strawberries, and I did add more than a pinch.  Grilling the cake was a novel twist but did nothing to enhance the flavor of it.  This turned out OK using the glaze, but I agree with the previous reviewers that there\u2019s an issue with the balsamic-sugar amounts, and I just didn\u2019t want to try to figure it out today.",
