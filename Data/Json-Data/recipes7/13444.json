I may have used more chips in the recipe as I had probably 2/3 of a bag to use up. It felt very heavy lifting it and I was afraid it might be dry brick. It wasn't... moist dense and superb. Any mix of chips and nuts would work well in this",

Maybe 3/4 cup.  I cream the cream cheese and butter plus shortening.  I used coconut oil. Add the sugar, I used a little less maybe 1/4 c.  Then eggs 2 at a time beating well after each addition. Add vanilla. Mix 1/4 c. Flour with chips an pecans coat thoroughly.  Mix all dry into egg mixture by hand with large spatula or spoon.  Place in well greased Bundt with extra nuts at bottom. Smooth top, bake at 325\u00b0 for 90 min or until tester comes out clean.  Try it !",
