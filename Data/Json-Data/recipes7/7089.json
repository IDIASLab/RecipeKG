But just that little bit of peanut butter really does take over the flavor of the smoothie.  Delicious!  And if you are a parent, this is a GREAT way to sneak some raw roughage into your child's diet.  Incidentally, the reviewers who use Vanilla yogurt instead of plain are right, that does enhance the taste a bit.  But I tried it both ways, and found both quite good.",

I used fresh spinach that I froze just for this recipe, did not have the yogurt, threw in a few strawberries and used Smart Balance pb. I always add cinnamon and vanilla to my smoothies. After blending, I took a spoonful, sampled it, pulled the spoon away to look at it and said (to no one in particular) - \"No way...!\" This is downright yummy! I was sad when I finished it (though a bit relieved, as I was quite full!) Intended to add protein powder to it, but I couldn't find where hubby put it - will add next time (ie - tomorrow!) for the protein punch. Spinach...who would have ever guessed...?",
