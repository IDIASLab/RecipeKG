I followed this recipe as close as I could, adding a teaspoon of baking powder and I used whole wheat white flour. I thought these were good, though next time I'd add some chopped pecans or walnuts and maybe some cinnamon or nutmeg next time. I didn't like the chocolate chips, though my kids and husband did. I'd like to try Hershey's cinnamon chips in this recipe next time. Quite tasty and they smell amazing while baking! Thanks for the laughs......and a new banana muffin recipe!",
