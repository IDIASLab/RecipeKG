I don't like to make changes to a recipe first time through, but I just knew that this would have too much sugar and cinnamon for us (personal taste preference), so I cut back on both.  The house smelled wonderful while this was baking, and we could barely keep ourselves from cutting into it after it came out of the oven.  This was a sweet and juicy apple crisp with a flavorful cinnamon roll base, just delicious.  The most time consuming part of this recipe is peeling and slicing the apples, but it's time well invested because this one's a keeper.",

Rolling the cinnamon buns out on the counter wasn't really working for me, so I unrolled the cinnamon buns in strips to cover the bottom of the pan.
