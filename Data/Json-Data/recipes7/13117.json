I found the sauce to noodle ratio way off, I only added 8oz of noodles and still found the dish too dry and not saucy enough to coat the noodles, meat, and veggies.  I added some prepared stir fry sauce to save the dish.  Probably could have added some broth, too.  I used ground chicken and spicy ground pork instead of diced chicken.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!",
