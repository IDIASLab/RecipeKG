My only 2 suggestions would be to #1 cube the meat before browning because having to cut the meat in the bowl was a bit awkward and #2 give the meat the time to cook that the peppers are--I didn't see any need for leaving the meat out as they cooked and am glad I didn't.",

You don't taste the ketchup at all it actually was less sweet than I thought this would be. This definitely takes a bit of work and a lot of time but it's soooooo good. The beef wasn't tender after 1 hour and 20 minutes - might try throwing this into the slow cooker next time (and add the veggies at the end). I threw the crushed peppercorns crushed garlic into a bouquet garni bag which worked great - I don't like eating peppercorns and didn't want to have to fish it out later. I crushed the peppercorns in a Ziploc bag with the meat pounder). Next time I'll throw the bay leaves in there as well - it was annoying to have to fish them out later especially since one had broken into several pieces during stirring while it was still dry. They're no fun to eat! I can't believe how much sauce this makes - I really wanted bread but decided to serve it over brown rice. Also instead of using 2 pots I switched the order and browned the meat then the onions/garlic all in the same pot (making sure not to burn them). This way all the goodness and flavor bits all stay together!",
