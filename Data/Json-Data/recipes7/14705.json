But it makes a very large batch great for a holiday gathering. They hold together rather well when cutting though crumbly and messy when eating them. I accidentally added the cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust mix also but still also added it to the apple mixture and it was amazing. I pressed the crust on top but next time I would more so sprinkle it so that it looks more crumby. No one will EVER know that this is not apple! Enjoy!!!",
