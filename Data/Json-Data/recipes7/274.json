The cranberries were a nice complement to the fall holiday table. It was very easy to prepare. I didn't have a pan larger than 9x13 so I cooked it in a 8x11 and placed in a 9x13 dish for the bath. I already plan to make it for Thanksgiving and I've been asked to forward the recipe to my mom who plans to serve it for an up-coming dinner party. This will definitely become a part of my cooking repitoire. Enjoy!!",

I think if I try this again I would cut way back on the milk/creamer to obtain a more \"cake-like\" texture.",
