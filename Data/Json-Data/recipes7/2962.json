It's a fair amount of work juicing all the lemons & limes but the final taste is worth it for sure. I rated the recipe a '4' because I used 1/2 the amount of tequila (using the whole amount would have been waaaaay too much for me). I also omitted the egg white; although I'm not too squeamish about raw egg myself I'm bringing it to serve to a group. Plus I want to use the leftover sour mix to make lemonade for my kids. Thanks for the recipe!!",

I made as directed without the egg white (Seemed kinda odd to me) and by mistake I did not add that last 1/2 cup of lime juice. I don't know why... I didn't even see it in the ingredients somehow! I did use a mixture of lemons and limes in the sour mix though and it was slightly more than the 1/ 1/2 cups. I poured all of that into the pitcher. It's weird the recipe tells you to make all that sour mix and not use it all... But the end result were very good margaritas that are not too sweet. I used only 1 1/2 cups tequila instead of 2 cups and although I would have preferred them full strength all my guests still thought they were pretty strong and were glad I didn't use anymore tequila than that. I also kept the remaining simple syrup and let people add some if they preferred a sweeter taste.",
