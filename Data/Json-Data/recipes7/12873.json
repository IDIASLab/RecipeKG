First, I scaled this down to one serving which could almost guarantee an iffy result.  I had no tapioca here at our place in Naples, so I substituted cornstarch with a guess.  I had no orange juice and wasn\u2019t comfortable using lemon, fearing it would negatively affect the sweetness factor as well as camouflaging the pure blueberry flavor I desired.  I used water instead, as well as omitting the cinnamon altogether for the same reason.  Finally, I was using a new convection toaster oven here for the first time and was uncertain how to adjust the time.  Twenty minutes proved to be perfect, and even at that I found I had to cover the crisp with foil toward the end of the cooking time to prevent it from overbrowning.  The result was perfect \u2013 neither too dry nor too juicy, just right, and with the perfect level of sweetness.  Hubs said to mention that he had nothing to say while he was eating it which meant he was totally enjoying the experience.  For myself, I really appreciated a crisp with no oats.  This was just darned good as well as darned quick and easy.",

I baked this in a 1.5 qt baking dish and it was a lot more blueberries than topping. Nice change from using oats. Had warm with whipped cream but will do with vanilla ice cream.
