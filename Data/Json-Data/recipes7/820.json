I would recommend making two batches of twelve muffins or one batch of muffins in the jumbo muffin pans and cooking them for even as long as double the time. Also definitely use the muffin liners because spraying the pan does not work well for these muffins. Other than that these are amazing muffins! They taste great.",

I did (2) 6-muffin batches in the normal sized muffin pans but next time I would do (3) batches. Also I just guessed and used a box white cake mix because I was not sure what \"all-purpose baking mix\" meant. These turned out great. Everyone loved them. They were soft in the center and the streusel topping was yummy! Will definitely make these again.",
