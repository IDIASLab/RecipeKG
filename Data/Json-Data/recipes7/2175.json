I added 1/2 teaspoon salt and I'm glad I did.  I cut the cayenne down to 1/4 teaspoon based on other reviews, but then it was barely detectable at all.  Next time I will definitely add the full 1/2 teaspoon...and I'm not one for a lot of cayenne.  I reduced the oven temp down to 325 degrees to try and avoid the burning that other reviews mentioned, but mine still burnt a bit on the bottom.  Next time I'll lower it down to 300 degrees and check them at 12 minutes instead of 15.  I also used parchment paper (not foil) and had no problem with the nuts sticking.  I plan on making these again for holiday gift giving...Thanks!",
