However it seems that some instructions are missing (like where does the other half of the mango go?!) Obviously minor details but I blended it the spices and the onion together and worked out well. If a blender is not available I also made it finely chopping up everything (I got a new knife needed to try it out) and it works just as well. Anyways great recipe just use your imagination to fill it out",

There is a step missing about adding the other half of the mango with the 2nd sliced onion before simmering. Also I think you can skip the step where you put the chicken in a bag with the smushed ingredients. It works fine to mix the first part of the ingredients in the pan with the melted butter then add the chicken unless maybe you're supposed to marinate it in the bag (?) which I don't think it needs because it tasted great without. This works with or without raisins too.",

Sugar needs to be cut in half at least. Next time I will also try using a bit more vinegar and maybe some chicken bouillon or something. Also throw in the extra spices you dipped the chicken in while it's cooking - excellent flavor will definitely make again.",
