I recommend only making one loaf form this recipe, though...and to avoid the soggyness on the bottom of the loaf, dust bottom and sides of dough with cornmeal instead of greasing the pan. This bread was fantastic. I made it five times in a week. Gave two away and we ate the others ourselves. For the herbs I used sage, basil and oregano along with fresh rosemary (I dumped all the rosemary into the bread and did not sprinkle any on top). The salty taste of this bread makes it sooo good and we just could not get enough. When it's day old, it makes INCREDIBLE toast.",
