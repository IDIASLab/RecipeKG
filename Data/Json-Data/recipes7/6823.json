Polyunsaturated fats can have a beneficial effect on your health when consumed in moderation and when used to replace saturated fats (butter). Polyunsaturated fats can help reduce the cholesterol levels in your blood and lower your risk of heart disease. Also I substituted the white sugar with 2 tablespoons of Stevia baking blend. They came out delicious! Crunchy on outside chewy on inside.",
