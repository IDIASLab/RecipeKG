Gradually mix in the remaining flour until the dough is firm enough to knead on a lightly floured surface. If you have a stand mixer with a bread hook attachment, you may use that instead. Knead or mix dough until small gas bubbles form and dough is smooth, about 10 minutes. Work in the currants at the very end so they don't become pulverized. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat, and cover the bowl with a towel. Set aside to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\n"
