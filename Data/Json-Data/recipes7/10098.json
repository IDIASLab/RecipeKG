The first time I made this, I followed the directions to the letter and it separated after processing in the water bath and never gets thick like jam until it is in the fridge, once in the fridge it gets thick and stayed mixed so... still good! The second time around, I made a few modifications...\n1) Started with a blender and pulverized the green tomatoes till I had 5 smooth cups.\n2) measured 2 cups whole Fresh NOT frozen raspberries (Frozen add to much unnecessary water as they defrost) directly into the already blended tomatoes.\n3) Only added 1 jalape\u00f1o, spliced with seeds removed (seeds are the hottest part of the pepper) and pulverized it in with the rest of it all. Once blended to my liking, I brought them to a boil like the directions suggested for 5 or so minutes stirring intermittently before adding the sugar. I let that sugar simmer while consistently stirring another 5 minutes until well milted. Then stirred gelatin in, half at a time, and stirred while simmering for 3 mins. Then processed for canning according to the directions.\n\nI found that these little alterations made less mess, faster overall canning, kid friendly taste, and thicker more jelly consistency that never again separated after processed. \n\nI tried removing the jalape\u00f1os all together and found that it was very average tasting jelly that I might as well just buy it in th",

My problem with the recipe is that it's missing the number of jars to sterilize and how much this recipe will make?? I know people might use different sized jars but it would be good to say something like \"will make 1 gallon of jam\" or something similar. I'll just work up more jars than I think it will make to be safe but that would be a good \"edit\" to the recipe. Thanks for sharing.",

It added a lot more depth of flavor compared to the jam recipes without it. In fact the recipe tasted great before I even added the jello package. The single jalapeno gave it a little zing at the end. I am not a heat lover when it comes to salsa or anything else and 1 seedless jalapeno was perfect. Next time I make it I will do 1/2 the sugar, stick with 1 seedless jalapeno, stick with frozen berry mix, do 3oz package of raspberry jello and 6oz flavorless gelatin (to make up for extra liquid.) Also I will cook it longer (10-15 min or so) after adding the gelatin. I blended the tomatos after chopping, no need to remove skins, you cannot tell they are in there. Then blended it after cooking and it made it super smooth. Pour into hot jars and seal, no need to waterbath.",
