I proofed the yeast with the warm water and the sugar (I cut the sugar back to a quarter cup) for ten minutes then added the potato flakes milk salt eggs flour and melted margerine. I kneaded the dough with the bread hook for about five minutes then set the dough to rise for an hour or so in a large greased bowl on a warm heating pad. I rolled out the dough and mixed the softened butter together with the brown sugar and cinnamon before I spread it on the dough. I sliced them up and set them in baking pans covered them with foil and set them either on the warm heating pad or over my warm oven (I put six rolls in each pan. The reason I did this is because I wanted room for them to rise and I didn't want to worry about some rolls being undercooked in the end). 400 degrees for a little over 15 minutes and they were done. When I made the icing I used milk instead of water and I did increase the vanilla a touch. They look beautiful. One pan is a gift for my in-laws one pan is for my son's birthday breakfast tomorrow. EDITED REVIEW: Everyone loved them especially the birthday boy.",
