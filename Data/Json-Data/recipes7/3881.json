I really had to doctor it up and its still bland. I have been making gravy for 35 years and consider myself a very experienced cook. I knew this recipe looked bland but I figured what the heck.

I did not leave to whole bones in the sauce. I pulled off the meat added the meat back to the sauce and gave the bones to the dogs. For the meatballs instead of the bread soaked in water I used dry bread crumbs. I cooked it a day ahead of time so the flavors would have time meld together. I also could not find ground veal at the store so instead I used more pork (really italian saugage) for more added flavor and ground hamburger to make up for the pound of veal that i did not have. I was serving 10 people and use one pound of thin spaghetti. I had plenty of sauce and meatballs left over to freeze and kept some meatballs and sauce to make sub sandwiches with. My overall rating is I think it turned out nicely with my own cooking techinques and touch. I served with a salad and buttered bread.",
