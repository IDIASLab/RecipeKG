I halved the recipe and used a blender because I was afraid there wouldn't be enough cantaloup flavor otherwise. It's really good. Next time I'll not use the blender and probably still half the sugar not sure. Def. can see this being nice to sip on the front porch during the summer. Right now it's making the winter not seem so cold.:)",

I don't have them so I used a melon zester instead. The difference is the thickness. This may be a weird drink to those that haven't seen such thing before like my hubs lol but it is resfreshing. If doing it this way use a fork to take out the cantaloupe strings to eat..",
