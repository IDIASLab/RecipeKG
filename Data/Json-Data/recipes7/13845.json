I also added 2 eggs (for fear the peaches would not act as a binder like apples would)Maybe an egg or two would be a good idea even if you use applesauce? Also added about a cup of walnuts just because I try to feed my family nuts as much as possible. I baked it in a pyrex dish that measures about 7 1/2 x 12. Seemed too much batter for that dish so I also put some in a small 6x6 inch pyrex that I am going to freeze for my husband and I. Only baked them for 25-30 minutes or until it sprung back when touched. We farm and the guys are in the field now so I will be taking these to the field as a treat! (also wonderful with a dip of ice cream alongside)",
