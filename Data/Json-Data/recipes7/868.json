Instead of the milk and water I added that much of the proofed starter and omitted that much of the flour. I added the started to the heated butter and added a bit of flour to feed it and let it sit for about an hour and then added the rest of the ingredients (omitting a bit of the flour and just dropping it into the stalk instead of rolling out). It was wonderful in our chicken soup the only change I might make next time is to use a little less sugar. That might have been from the sweetness already in my starter though.",

I agree with poster who said they were too large though I would probably cut 1\" x 2\" squares next time and maybe roll the dough a little thinner than 1/2\" -- but will definitely make these again.",

These are the heavy dense kinds of dumplings that I like. I used only 1 egg and 1/2 cup of Egg Beaters. I used only 2 T of reduced calorie margarine and only 1/4 cup of sugar. I fed the yeast a teaspoon of sugar so that it really fluffed up before using it. I had to use about an extra cup of flour to make it not sticky (perhaps because of the changes I made) but the flavor and texture was perfect after boiling in my homemade chicken broth for about 45 minutes.
