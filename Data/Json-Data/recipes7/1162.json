This recipe is so simple and delish. Made me feel like a pro. Got great reviews. Reminded me of \"Drunken Shallots\" I had had at a favorite local Italian restaurant (although I think those used a red wine reduction). Planning on making the full recipe from frozen onions for a camping trip this weekend. Such an easy snack to put out with some white bean spread (also easy and both not bad nutrition-wise). Highly recommend this recipe. Be patient with the reduction. It's worth it to let it get thick.",
