I cook on high heat for an hour, stirring often, then turn it down to low for 4 - 5 hours.  The trick to get it to reduce is to not put the lid securely on the pot.  I put a double layer of paper towels, lay a wooden spoon or skewer toward one side of the pot and place the lid on top.  There needs to be a gap under the lid, so the water can evaporate from the milk.  Also, it works best with whole milk - regular or lactose free.  To check progress on the reduction, put a wooden skewer in the pot and measure the amount of liquid.  I use a marker  to mark the stick. Then you can stick the skewer in every hour or so to measure your progress.",
