They are super pretty, rich, and chewy from the additions of mini marshmallows and hot chocolate mix with just the right amount of peppermint flavor from the crushed candy canes.

If you chill the dough for about 30 minutes you can roll them into 1 inch (or smaller) balls then you can just press them into the crushed candy canes. Had to use frozen almond bark in place of white chocolate. Melted it in microwave and mixed it in before chilling the dough. Cookies turned out great. This is a \"keeper\" recipe.",

Thought they would taste better than they looked. Well partly. Although the cookie itself had a good flavor they were so sticky and chewie I had to chisel them off my teeth. Since they had a good flavor I thought I might try them again. Didn't soften the butter in the microwave and used a new box of baking soda. Nope it didn't help. Sitting here looking at the second batch of hot chocolate crispy wafers. Good idea horrible recipe. You'll do better to make a cup of hot cocoa put some marshmallows in it and stir it up with a candy cane.",

Well they still flattened out ridiculously I had a tough time getting them off the pan. My best batch was put in the fridge before baking then baked on parchment paper and immediately after removing from the oven I took the parchment paper off the hot pan to finish cooling on a rack. I didn't taste much hot cocoa either. My thought is that there is just too much sugar in this recipe though the cookies were oddly addicting while still warm. I will not make this recipe again.",
