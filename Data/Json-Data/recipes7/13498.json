The bacon and onions give it some additional flavor and the taste definitely doesn't resemble the bitterness of my childhood memory.  I also like the addition of the sugar which adds a hint of sweetness, although I used maybe two teaspoons instead of the  two tablespoons.  I too added garlic.  This recipe is a winner!
