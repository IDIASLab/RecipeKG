This is a great base for add-ins like dried cranberries and white or dark chocolate chips. These come out of the oven beautiful... almost look too good to eat!",

I much prefer to read reviews that are made as outlined. When you change things without having made the original first, you're not really giving an accurate review. As far as I know, there is no true way to make scones. Not unless you invented them. I've been making scones for my husband for over 40 years and we enjoy the many different takes on scones. We do like currants in the scones and we usually eat them after dinner for dessert instead of in the morning.  This is a very good recipe which I will make again and added it to my huge collection of scone recipes. Thank you Chef John!",

I ended up increasing the amount of flour to about 2 cups and I would have added just a little bit more sugar (not too much, since scones shouldn't be overly sweet and it would overpower the natural sweetness of the orange/cranberries I used).\n\nWith those adjustments, though, it's a great recipe! Very authentic and delicious! The center is moist but it's got a nice crusty outside. Like other reviewers said, it's so versatile! I might try lemon or candied ginger next time.",
