I would cut the sugar in half and add a pinch of salt. You NEED TO SIFT THE FLOUR... and if you don't use self-rising flour, add 3 teaspoons of baking powder. You can pour the melted butter on top when you first put it in. I baked for exactly 60 minutes. :)",

Also, I poured 3 Tbsp. melted butter over the unbaked loaf and baked at 350\u00b0 F for 47 minutes. Absolutely perfect and my house smelled SO good!\nFor the remaining three loaves I followed the recipe reducing the sugar to 2 Tbsp, adding 2 Tbsp of Italian herbs seasoning (store brand) and just a pinch of salt.\nI once again poured 3 Tbsp. melted butter over the unbaked loaf and set to bake at 350\u00b0 F for 40 minutes. At this point I opened the oven to add 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese to the top of the loaf, then returning to bake another 7 minutes until golden brown on top. \nThis bread is just simply delicious any way that it is made.  I took two loaves to my sister's birthday party and the other two went to in-laws house. \nIt was delicious with our supper!\nI can't wait to make this again to go with chili when cooler weather arrives!  First chilly day we get, I'll be baking this bread!  Thank you, Cassie for sharing your recipe! \nTammy ??",
