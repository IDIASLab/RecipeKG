I omitted the sugar (I just forgot actually), and used dried dill instead of fresh (for converting to dried herbs, remember the baseline of 1 TBSP fresh = 1 TSP dried), and it was quite the nice accent. I imagine the vegetable selections are exchangeable, but I prefer to eat vegetables that I normally don't (the radish!), and this combo of flavours works well. Leaving it to set is also definitely important - I taste tested multiple times during the hour, and it was definitely better the longer it sat. Will make this again, esp. in the summer.",

The \"dressing\" was olive oil with a hint of vinegar. I literally couldn't eat it. I might as well have been drinking olive oil out of the bottle. I think however if you made the dressing actually a vinaigrette instead of olive oil then this would be decent. I would also cut back on the onions as red onions are very strong and maybe add more cucumber. Also in terms of quantity there was just too much dressing compared to the ingredients. They were swimming in it.",

The recipe calls for 4 teaspoons of olive oil per serving which is 18 fat grams per serving. So if you serve this dish with a slotted spoon you won't be eating that full amount of the dressing.",
