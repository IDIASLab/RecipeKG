Unfortunately it wasn't. The cardamom was completely overpowering for my taste although my husband did like it. The texture is not light and fluff like cakes normally are instead it's heavy and dense. I thought the taste was better with fresh whipped cream or ice cream. One more thing the cake was in the oven for 45 minutes before the knife came out clean. I don't envision baking this again but I appreciate the recipe..",

Perhaps the recipe submitter's oven runs hot or she has a convection oven. bc 300 would never work in my oven! I baked for 40 minutes and it wasn't done so I meant to add another 20 mins on the timer. I somehow forgot to set it or something bc some time later I realized I hadn't heard the timer in at least a half hour maybe 40 mins and ran to check on the cake. Weirdly it was fine. Perfectly baked--maybe a tad dry but hey whatever--and not burned at all. I thought it turned out well. Bf didn't comment on the cardamom--and believe me he would have if it was too much for him; he has before!--and I thought it was a perfect amount. His only comment was that his first bite of apple was a tad sour--I guess one apple piece was a bit much but the rest were fine. So my only advice would be to 1. Remember to set the timer! You might not be lucky like I was and 2. Make sure your apples are sweet not sour. Thanks for the recipe! A nice almost coffee type cake.:o)",
