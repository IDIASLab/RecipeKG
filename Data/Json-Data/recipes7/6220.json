It can be a little tricky on step 8, because it doesn't say to knead dough after you punch down, but it's a must. I learned this on 1st batch, I followed recipe exactly as called for, but noticed the 1st doughnuts didn't rise near as well as the trimmings I kneaded back into a ball and rolled out again...even made a chocolate glaze to add a little variety.  2nd batch, I mixed in ground cinnamon in step #8 the kneaded & rolled out then cut dough into 1 inch strips and folded to make cinnamon twists then coated with glaze (I doubled the glaze mixture) and /or with cinnamon sugar... Phenomenal!!! All gone before I could take a pic(not kidding). 3rd batch, followed steps 1-7 then at 8 after punching dough I added 3 TBS powdered cinnamon and 2 chopped apples and kneaded as recipe calls for & separated & pressed out fritters. Follow steps 9-11, I had to triple step 12 to have enough glaze but it turned out great!",

I'm not a fan of the cake texture and really wanted a Dunkin-raised donut so when I was finished around 10 pm, I started again...this time mixing everything by hand (really don't need the mixer) and trying to mix as little as possible. For my do-over batch, I also used rapid rise yeast and did not sift the flour to speed things up. Also increased sugar to 1/3 to sweeten the dough. I let the dough rise in a slightly warm oven for about 50 min. (I tested a tip to pour 3-4 C of boiling water into a pan and leave it on the bottom of the oven to warm it perfectly...worked great!) I cut the dough into strips instead of donut rings to save time and eliminate scraps. (Re-rolling the scraps made tough donuts.) Then I left the dough on the counter under loosely draped plastic wrap for 45 min. Everything turned out perfect. Kids all said this morning that they taste like Dunkin! I second another reviewer's suggestion to use the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze found on this site. It's delicious...tastes like Dunkin!",

We let the bread machine make the dough; it rose beautifully. I then rolled them out, and DS cut them out. I put them on cookie sheets and let rise in the oven with the light on for 30 minutes. We didn't try the glaze but frosted instead with buttercream icing and sprinkles. Fun morning, and now my tummy hurts a bit from eating too many. ;)  *Update- have made these several times now. My kids love them. I don't have a donut cutter, so per the cook's notes, I use a can and pill bottle. It works great!",
