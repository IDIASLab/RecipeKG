This recipe was very similar to that, however the nutmeg added gave the haupia sort of dirty color. (The taste of the nutmeg was great though). The haupia I've had before was a milky-white color, which to me was much more appealing. I think this recipe was actually very simple, however I choose to skip the part where you make your own coconut milk, and just added three cups of canned coco-milk instead. In Hawaii they sell powdered haupia, which you just add water and boil, and let it set up. This recipe had a much better taste than the mix did! Thanks for the recipe!",

Googled & it seems like noone else has any helpful tips either. LOL It's very tedious scraping the coconut out & I don't think I'll be doing it again.;o) On the plus side I got some really cool coconut halves to use as dishes.",
