I made 12..half with the strawberry jam and half without..i preferred without. The sweetened strawberry mixture was plenty flavor enough. The whipped topping was spot on in sweetness. I added 2 teaspoons of cream of tartar to the whipping cream so it can give it a touch more stability making them last just a bit longer in the fridge. Thanks for sharing this recipe a great combo of flavors! UPDATE: 48 hours after making these..the whipped topping with the added cream of tartar in it has lasted perfectly..in the fridge of course. So with this addition these can easily be made the night before!",
