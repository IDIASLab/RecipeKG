I wisked together the dry ingredients in small bowl with the chocolate chips (tossing the chocolate chips in with the dry ingredients helps them not to sink to the bottom of the muffin tin) and I combined all the wet ingredients (including the cherries), then folded the dry ingredients carefully into the wet. I did not have a jumbo muffin tin, only regular sized muffin tins. I was able to get 24 biggish muffins out of one recipe, baking them at 350 for 20 minutes. That baking temperature and time has always worked for me while baking muffins. These muffins turned out moist, chocolate-y and just WONDERFUL. My two boys just fell in love with them. My husband didn't say anything but he ate four in one sitting, so they must have been good. The amount of chocolate to cherries and the little chocolate chips was perfect. One of THE best muffins I've ever had. This recipe's a keeper.",

I added a fourth cup less sugar since the berries were sweet - & it could've used it without a problem of being too sweet. I'm sure cherries would be better but I was in the situation of too many blueberries. (Still am:D) Sooo using blueberries we all agreed they'd be better without 'em.:) I liked the minichips spiking it. 'Have to use that idea again. Oh I subbed half plain nonfat yogurt & half reduced fat sour cream. No problems. Oh & one recipe made 20 muffins not 12. Yeah 20 regular size muffins - 3/4 full.
