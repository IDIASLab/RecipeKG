You can also add just about anything else to this, that's why it's 'anything goes.' Add browned ground beef or turkey for a meaty, almost chili-like main dish. Garnish with diced hard-boiled eggs. Add chopped olives. Sometimes, I add cooked peas. I love the leftovers with scrambled eggs for breakfast; it's great the second day and in tortillas for lunch.",

Guess I'm glad we tried!\" We ate Goya's AR recipe for black beans last week so I guess we were spoiled from how fantastic they were but this particular recipe just didn't make our tastebuds jig. First thing that was \"off\" was the addition of tomato paste along w/ the copious amounts of bell pepper and onion that drowned out the beans which were the main \"guts\" of this side dish. We had to add more than a dash of Chipotle Tabasco when we served it (at least to my husband and I's plate) and our daughter insisted on melting lots of cheese on top of hers.",
