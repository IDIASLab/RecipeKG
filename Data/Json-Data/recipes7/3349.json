I have worked in catering and at fancy events we would prepare a cheese tray with many different cheeses and ramekins of honey (sprinkled with a few white sesame seeds) and chutney along with nice crackers. We provided little demitasse spoons and cheese knives so everyone could pick their favorite cracker and cheese and then drizzle some honey and chutney on top. The sweet/savory flavor is so sophisticated! This combination was always available at the most elegant events. Just be sure to not cook too long or you will end up with cherry jam!",
