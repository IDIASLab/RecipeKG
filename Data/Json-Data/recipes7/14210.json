                "reviewBody": "I scaled to 11 servings for the cake part as I wanted to bake in a 9x13 pan I should have made the full amount as the cake was very thin. I used pecans for the walnuts as I do not like walnuts. I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp as well as baking soda is salty. The cake had an odd gummy texture even though the toothpick was clean at 30 minutes I wonder if it was from the cooked carrots as I have only used grated raw carrots previously in carrot cakes. The cake smelled great will baking but I found the spiciness missing maybe using pumpkin pie or apple pie spice may be better to add more flavour. I halved the frosting part as I was not doing layers 1/3 probably would have been better. There was no discernible lemon flavour maybe lemon zest in addition to the juice would have helped. The frosting is very soft as well extra icing sugar is definitely required. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #FacelessNoMore",
