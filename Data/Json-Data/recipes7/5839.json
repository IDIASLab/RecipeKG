Instead of freezing them, I just put the vegetables and meat in 2 separate small ziplock bags and refridgerated them 4-5 hours before cooking. The only changes I made was for the meat I had 2 NY Strip steaks. I trimmed the fat and cut them into 1\" cubes. Out of everything I got 8 kabobs and at most about 3 servings. I did 1/2 red and 1/2 green bell pepper for the peppers, as it was what I had, and I also subbed white wine vinegar for the cider vinegar for the same reason. I definitely plan to make this again, but next time I will double it!",

I highly suggest saving some of this sauce as a \"dip\" for additional meat. Maybe try this on burgers? Good stuff!",
