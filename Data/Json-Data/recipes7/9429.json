I do make a few modifications (though it's perfectly great as written!): I omit the tuna and cucumber and add a few stalks of finely chopped celery. I also swap out the Miracle Whip for real mayo and use radiatore-shaped pasta instead of elbow macaroni. Oh and red onion instead of white. I find that the radiatore holds helps to trap the creamy dressing and bits of egg and veggies. I make the dressing exactly as written with the yellow mustard sugar and milk and it's SO good. This is now my go-to recipe and every time I have a potluck or family gathering people beg me to make it. Thank you for such a great concoction!",
