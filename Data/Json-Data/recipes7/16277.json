The published recipe and the personal recipe both mentioned 3/4 c of brown sugar but there is no mention where to add it... the crust, the topping, the filling....?  Anyway, I left it out entirely and it  was perfect.  It would have been too sweet with the extra sugar.  4  cups of mangoes was 3 very large mangoes for me.",

Like a few other reviewers I didn't use brown sugar and did not see the need for it at all I would double the crust recipe next time and use half for the bottom and half for the top.

I did adjust the recipe for the ingredients I had on hand - almonds instead of macadamia nuts honey instead of white sugar in the filling and frozen tropical mix of mangoes strawberries pineapples and peaches (I chopped the larger chunks) instead of fresh chopped mangoes. What a forgiving recipe! Honey worked just fine and I didn t focus on reducing just cooked down the fruit filling until it looked thick enough. Used only 3 tbsp cornstarch and that was enough. Can't wait to try this basic recipe for all different types of fruit combinations. Yum yum yum!",

A little too buttery but it passed with the family.",

                "reviewBody": "These have potential but the recipe as-is has some issues. First off the reviewer that said that the crust was not enough to line a 13 x 9 pan was right. I had to use the entire crust to be able to cover the bottom of the pan. Second the crust was very bland. It really needs a hit of salt and maybe a dash of vanilla. I altered the filling because I didn't see the point of adding water when mango releases so much liquid when it's cooked. So I cooked the mango with the sugar lemon juice and 2 tbsp cornstarch and it was just fine. Since I used all of the crust on the bottom I ended up throwing together a crumb topping to go on top. As-is the recipe is 3 stars especially because the proportions are WAY off. But it can be made a 5-star recipe with some alterations.",
