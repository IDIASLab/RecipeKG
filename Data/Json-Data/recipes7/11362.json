The sweetness of the peach and smooth cream gets a boost from the earthy spices without being overpowering. I eat it plain but a few friends enjoy it in ice cream sandwiches.",

The only thing I could think of is that the peach puree should be cooked separately with the spices then added with the diced fresh peaches at the end. But if that's the meaning it's very unclear. Anyway I pitched the whole thing and will try a different recipe.",
