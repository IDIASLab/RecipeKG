I added 1/2 cup each of flour and sugar to the fruit with 1 tsp cinnamon. For the rolled oat mixture I reduced the brown sugar and butter to 3/4 cup each, keeping the oats and flour the same, used white whole wheat for the all purpose, and added another tsp of cinnamon instead of sprinkling cinnamon sugar over the top. Mine baked in 45 minutes exactly. Crisps and crumbles are easily costumized to your tastes, this recipe just had way too much sugar for us, we like the tartness of rhubarb.
