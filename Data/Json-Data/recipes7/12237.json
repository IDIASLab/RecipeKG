The use of light corn syrup lets the pecan goodness shine through, rather than overwhelming with sugary sweetness. Be careful when eating these - if you get some of the filling on your face, your tongue may beat you to death trying to get to it! Try serving warm with vanilla ice cream. Serve warm or cool and place in airtight containers up to 1 week.",

The recipe made 36 little pecan tarts.  I made these for a company Thanksgiving potluck and everyone raved!  They were the best tasting (and best textured) pecan pies I've ever made and they were the perfect serving size for a gathering with lots of deserts to try.  Extremely pleased and this recipe will go in my personal recipe collection to be used over and over again!",
