I used Egg Beaters, Splenda Sugar Blend, and substituted half of the oil with applesauce.  Even with these modifications, this bread came out melt-in-your-mouth moist and flavorful.  I don't mind raspberry seeds (now blackberries, that's a different issue), so I didn't sieve them.  I wanted to have some chunks of raspberries in the bread, so I just lightly mashed them and added them along with the flour.  I was concerned that if I beat the raspberries with the mixer, it would totally pulverize them.  Thicknik, my apologies for the changes, since I don't usually do that the first time through.  I had an idea of what I wanted, and this still is a delicious bread.  For others who are watching their diet as I am these days, this will give them an option.  Either the way it's written or the way I prepared it, it's still a winner.  Thanks for sharing.",

Regardless of the kind of oil used, it really adds hundreds of thousands of calories for the whole batch. I used fresh raspberries so put in a cup instead of three-fourths.

Since I had so many fresh raspberries I used like 1 1/2 c. and just mashed them up. I didn't have any lemon extract or real lemon juice on hand so I just used like a tablespoon or so of orange juice. I used 1/3 c. oil and a splash of ginger ale (I had opened a can and figured why the hell not!) THESE WERE AMAZING! The perfect breakfast muffin! They have my house smelling so good.
