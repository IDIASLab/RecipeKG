I followed the recipe exactly, but put the ingredients into the pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer of my machine, NOT in the order listed here.  I used bread machine yeast, so did not proof the yeast in the water; I added the water and oil, then the flour, then the spices, salt, and sugar around the edge, and put the yeast in a little crater in the middle.  My machine makes 2-3 lb loaves so I set in on white, two pound, light crust, and it rose up so fluffy and perfect.  Great sandwich bread too!  I've printed this recipe and can't wait to make more.",
