I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so made some modifications trying to keep with the spirit of the recipe (dried herbs instead of fresh, onion instead of shallot). I also value speed when preparing meals so instead of marinating, I just poured the marinade on top of the fillets, dumped some diced vegetables on top of them, and put them all in the oven together. A full, well-balanced, tasty dinner was on the table within 20 minutes of arriving home. Can't beat that.",

The second time I made it (not realizing I already tried this one), I put the fish in a 9X13 baking dish and scooped the marinade over the fish. I allowed this to sit for approx. 1 1/2 hours until baking it.  I put sliced zucchini over the top, added some additional sea salt and fresh ground pepper. Then covered with foil and baked at 450 for approx. 23 min. or until zucchini was crisp tender.  This was awesome!!! The whole family devoured it, including my picky 2 year old who even scraped her plate for the first time ever!!!",

Cut the tequila to 1 tbs. Even with the extra splash of lime I was hoping for a more limey flavor. (Also sprinkled a bit of cayenne over my portion.)
