I made 1/2 recipe. That amount yielded 1 coffee cup, which was all I wanted. Instead of whisking and heating the milk on the stove top, I just put it in my Nespresso frother to save time and dishes. I mixed the frothed milk and other ingredients into a cup. I decided to strain it, as the directions suggested. I honestly, did not see a difference though. I ended up adding a tad more coffee, but it was mainly just to mask the sweetness. I do not care for sugar in coffee, but wanted to follow the directions. I would make this again, with leftover pumpkin, just reducing the sugar some for personal preference.",

It is important to strain or otherwise you will have pumpkin spice sludge in your cup. Overall when all was said and done my husband said this was better than starbucks.",
