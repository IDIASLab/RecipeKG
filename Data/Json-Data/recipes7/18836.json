The topping was a little messy...way too many chocolate chips (if there is such a thing.) I made them for a road trip but they are too messy for eating in the car. Maybe next time I will tamp the topping into the batter before baking. And cut the choc chip amount in half. I didn't have enough pecans (I didn't notice they are listed twice) so I threw in a handful of unsweetened coconut which was really nice. I only had plain Greek yogurt but I just put a tiny bit more vanilla in to compensate. I think the recipe must be for jumbo muffins because it made exactly double the number of standard size muffins.

I should have thought to decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp because I used salted butter (so it was a bit too salty), but otherwise it came out great!  \nI did make a few substitutions due to family preferences. . . put in shredded coconut in the place of pecans (both in batter & topping). . . and didn't have oat flour, so used some wheat bran, ground flax seeds, & quick oats instead.  Will come back to this recipe again!  :)",

I skipped the nuts (family doesn't like them in baked goods) and increased the chocolate chips in the muffin batter (because we love chocolate) and also skipped the topping (seemed unnecessary especially with the extra chocolate chips.) I also used plain greek yogurt and increased the vanilla by 1/4 tsp because I only had plain yogurt on hand; and added some plain coconut flakes to the batter since I wasn't doing the topping but I liked the idea of having a bit of coconut flavor in the muffins. Great recipe and easy to adapt to personal tastes.",
