Round steak is a very tough meat, and does well with tomatoes (the ketchup) and the long, slow cooking. After I browned it I added all the other ingredients and simmered it on the stove for hours. It was very saucy and tender.  I thickened up the sauce and served it over mashed potatoes.  It was yummy.  I think I may add some green pepper and onion when I brown the meat next time.",

If it tastes a little too vinegary add some brown sugar and/or honey. I added a little of both and it was the finishing touch to make this recipe perfect! I also just cooked it on low on the stove top with a lid and the meat was as tender as can be for round steak. Will make again!!",
